We prove a Hitchin-Kobayashi correspondence for affine vortices generalizing a result of Jaffe-Taubes[16]for the action of the circle on the affine line. Namely, suppose a compact Lie group K has a Hamiltonian action on a Kähler manifold X which is either compact or a vector space with a linear convex action of K, and so that stable=semistable for the action of the complexified Lie group G. Then, for some sufficiently divisible integer n, there is a bijection between gauge equivalence classes of K-vortices with target X modulo gauge and isomorphism classes of maps from the weighted projective line P(1, n) to X/G that map the stacky point at infinity P(n) to the semistable locus in X. The results allow the construction and partial computation of the quantum Kirwan map in Woodward[32], and play a role in the conjectures of Dimofte, Gukov, and Hollands[9]relating vortex counts to knot invariants.

Introduction

In 1980, Jaffe-Taubes [16] provided a classification of finite energy vortices with circle group K = U (1) and target X = C. In this paper we generalize their classification to arbitrary compact Lie groups K and fiber bundles whose fiber X is either a compact Kähler manifold or a finite dimensional complex vector space. That is, we classify affine vortices with target X, these are pairs (A, u) where A is the connection on the principal bundle P = C × K, and u : C → P (X) := (P × X)/K is a holomorphic section, such that (A, u) satisfies the vortex equation: (1) * F A + Φ(u) = 0. 1 Here F A is the curvature of A, Φ : X → k ∨ is the moment map on X for the K-action, and * is the Hodge star for the standard metric on C.

Jaffe-Taubes [16] show that the gauge-equivalence class of a finite energy vortex is completely determined by the zeros of the section u, so that the moduli space of finite energy vortices is a symmetric product. This is a holomorphic description of the space of vortices with target C which from a more modern perspective may be viewed as a Hitchin-Kobayashi correspondence. Roughly speaking the correspondence takes a gauge-theoretic functional such as the Yang-Mills functional and shows that minima correspond to stable orbits. The first example of such a correspondence by Narasimhan and Seshadri [22] shows that stable holomorphic bundles over a Riemann surface correspond to irreducible unitary representations of the fundamental group. Donaldson [10] reproves the Narasimhan-Seshadri theorem in a differential-geometric setting, replacing irreducible unitary representations by an equivalent object -the minima of the Yang-Mills functional. The extension of this result to higher dimensional base manifold involved replacing a Yang-Mills connection by a Hermitian-Einstein connection. A holomorphic vector bundle admits a Hermitian-Einstein connection if and only if it is stable -this was proved for Kähler surfaces in [11] and for general compact Kähler manifolds by [27].

In the case of vortices one is interested in the study of holomorphic vector bundles over compact Kähler manifolds with additional data, for example a prescribed holomorphic section. Vortices are the zeros of the vortex functional given by the norm-square of (1). The zeros of the vortex functional correspond to minima of the Yang-Mills-Higgs functional -also called the energy functional for gauged holomorphic pairs. Bradlow's paper defines a stability condition for such objects and relates it to the existence of zeros of the vortex functional. Results in Bradlow [4] are used to investigate the moduli space of finite energy vortices in [5], [2] and [3]. In case of line bundles, [3] provides a complete description, which is a version of [16] in the case when the base when is a compact Kähler manifold. [21] generalized [4] by allowing the fiber to be a Kähler Hamiltonian manifold. All these Hitchin-Kobayashi results are infinite-dimensional versions of the abstract setting laid out in Kempf-Ness [17] and Kirwan [18], the main idea being that the symplectic quotient coincides with the geometric invariant theory quotient.

Our main result is the following. Recall that if C is a complex curve, then by a definition of Deligne-Mumford the category of morphisms from C to the quotient stack X/G is the category of pairs of a principal G-bundle over C together with a section of the associated fiber bundle P × G X. It contains as a proper open substack the git quotient X/ /G, here defined as the stack-theoretic quotient of the semistable locus by the action of G. Theorem 1.1. (Classification of affine vortices) Let X, G, K be as above, and let X/G denote the quotient stack. Let n be a positive integer such that for any x ∈ X ss , the order of the stabilizer group |G x | divides n. Then there exists a bijection between gauge equivalence classes of affine K-vortices with target X, and isomorphism classes of morphisms from P(1, n) to X/G such that P(n) maps to X/ /G.

A statement of the result which does not use stack language is given in Theorem 2.10 below. In the case that G is a torus acting on a finite dimensional complex vector space X, bundles on P(1, n) and sections of the associated vector bundle can be classified explicitly: Corollary 1.2. (Classification of affine vortices in the toric case) Suppose that G is a torus acting on a finite dimensional complex vector space X with weights µ 1 , . . . , µ k contained in an open half space, and spanning g ∨ . Then there is a bijection between affine vortices and isomorphism classes of tuples of polynomial maps u = (u 1 , . . . , u k ) : C → X satisfying (a) the degree of u j is at most µ j , d for each j = 1, . . . , k; and
(b) if u(∞) = u j (∞) := u ( µ j ,d ) j / µ j , d ! µ j , d ∈ Z 0 otherwise k j=1
denotes the vector of leading order coefficients ( µ j , d -th derivatives) with integer exponents, then u(∞) ∈ X ss .

Two such tuples are isomorphic if they are related by the action of G.
Example 1.3.
(a) (Jaffe-Taubes classification) If X = C with µ 1 = 1, then affine vortices of class d correspond to polynomials of degree exactly d up to the action of scalar multiplication, hence classified by their zeroes. This recovers the Jaffe-Taubes [16] result. (b) (Matrix-valued vortices and quot schemes) If X = M n (C), the space of n × n matrices and G = GL n , the semistable locus consists of invertible matrices and the action on the semistable locus is free. The above theorem gives a classification of vortices according to the following data: By Grothendieck's theorem [15], any vector bundle on P 1 splits as a sum of line bundles P × GLn(C) C n ∼ = O P 1 (λ 1 ) ⊕ . . . ⊕ O P 1 (λ n ), λ 1 ≥ . . . ≥ λ n .

The associated X bundle is then P (X) = O P 1 (λ 1 ) ⊕n ⊕ . . . ⊕ O P 1 (λ n ) ⊕n . A section u of P (X) may be viewed as a matrix-valued function on C. The semistability condition at infinity is then the condition that the leading order terms of u form an invertible matrix. Thus u defines a morphism of sheaves which is generically an isomorphism, providing a connection to the quot schemes considered in [1].

A recent paper of Xu [33] complements our work. It proves similar results as this paper for U (1)-vortices with fiber X = C m using results of [4]. It also shows a correspondence between compactifications of the space of affine vortices modulo gauge on the one side and the space of gauged holomorphic maps over P 1 , that are semistable at ∞.

The correspondence described here is partly motivated by a certain quantization of the Kirwan map that arises in the study of Gromov-Witten invariants of geometric invariant theory quotients. Namely Kirwan [18] constructs a map from the equivariant cohomology H G (X, Q) to the cohomology of the quotient H(X/ /G, Q). A Gromov-Witten generalization of [18] called the quantum Kirwan map, suggested by Gaio-Salamon [13], maps the equivariant quantum cohomology of X to the quantum cohomology of the quotient X/ /G. Affine vortices come up here: the quantum Kirwan is defined by counting affine vortices on X. The work of the second author [23], [32] generalizes the manifolds for which this map is defined -it removes monotonicity and asphericity assumptions on X. Also, the group action can have finite stabilizers on the zero-level set of the moment map, i.e. the symplectic quotient is an orbifold. This paper is part of that project. It provides an algebraic description for the moduli space of vortices, and from there, the quantum Kirwan map can be defined using Behrend-Fantechi machinery. A very important result in this context is a compactification for the space of affine vortices modulo gauge proved by Ziltener ([34], [35]).

An additional recent motivation arises from knot-invariants via vortex counting conjectures of Dimofte, Gukov, and Hollands [9], in which the equivariant index (defined via localization) of the moduli space of affine vortices is conjectured to be a certain knot invariant. Our results allow the identification of the moduli space of affine vortices with the quasimap spaces discussed in, for example, Bertram, Ciocan-Fontanine, and Kim [1]. The space of matrix-valued vortices in Example 1.3 appear as the relevant space of vortices for a torus knot in the vortex counting conjectures of Dimofte, Gukov, and Hollands [9].

The proof of the main result Theorem 1.1 uses the Hitchin-Kobayashi result for vortices on a compact base manifold with boundary proved by the first author [29], along with an implicit function argument outside a compact set. We may then use the method of exhaustion, solving the vortex equation on a succession of balls of increasing radius, to obtain a solution on the whole plane. Doing so involves a number of complications, such as that the sequence of solutions on the balls converges without bubbling.

We briefly sketch the contents of the paper. Section 2 defines gauged holomorphic maps and extends the definitions to the case when the base manifold Σ is an orbifold P(1, n). Section 3 introduces stacks and explains how gauged holomorphic maps can be seen as maps between stacks. Section 4 extends the Hitchin-Kobayashi result for compact Riemann surface with boundary in [29] to the case when the target is non-compact. The rest of the sections prove the main theorem.

Background and statement of results

Let G be a complex reductive Lie group, so it is the complexification of a maximal compact subgroup K. Let Σ be a Riemann surface and P → Σ a principal K-bundle. Let (X, ω) be a Kähler manifold on which G acts holomorphically.
Definition 2.1.
(a) (Hamiltonian actions) A moment map is a K-equivariant map Φ such that ι(ξ X )ω = d Φ, ξ , ∀ξ ∈ k, where ξ X ∈ Vect(X) given by the infinitesimal action of ξ on X. The action of K is Hamiltonian if there exists a moment map Φ : X → k * . Since K is compact, k has an Ad-invariant metric. We fix such a metric and k * and so the moment map becomes a map Φ : X → k. We assume X is equipped with a Hamiltonian action and fix the moment map. (b) (Geometric invariant theory quotients) If X is a polarized projective Gvariety, the geometric invariant theory quotient is X ss / ∼ where X ss is the semi-stable locus and ∼ is the orbit closure relation. We assume that the G-action on X ss has finite stabilizers. So, X/ /G is the orbit space of X ss . From Kempf-Ness [17] and Kirwan [18], the git quotient X/ /G is homeomorphic to the symplectic quotient X/ /K := Φ −1 (0)/K. The stable=semistable guarantees that the K action on Φ −1 (0) has finite stabilizers, and that X ss = GΦ −1 (0). The results in this work apply to compact Kähler manifolds, in these cases, abusing notation, we define X ss = GΦ −1 (0). (c) (Affine space of connections) Let (Σ, j) be a Riemann surface and P → Σ a principal K-bundle over it. In this paper, we mostly don't encounter closed Riemann surfaces, so we may assume that P = Σ × K. The space of connections is then the affine space
A(P ) := d + Ω 1 (Σ, k).
On any bundle over Σ, where the fiber has a K-action, a connection A = d+a defines a covariant derivative d A . For example on the bundle Σ × X,
d A := u → du + a u ∈ Ω 1 (Σ, u * T X).
At a point x ∈ Σ, a u (x) is the infinitesimal action of a(x) at u(x). The curvature of a connection A = d + a is
F A := da + [a ∧ a]/2 ∈ Ω 2 (Σ, k).
The curvature varies with the connection as
F A+ta = F A + td A a + t 2 2 [a ∧ a].
(d) (Gauge transformations) A gauge transformation is an automorphism of Pit is an equivariant bundle map P → P . The group of gauge transformations on P is denoted K(P ). On the trivial bundle Σ × K, k ∈ K(P ) is a map k : Σ → K. It acts on a connection A = d + a as
k(A) = d + (dkk −1 + Ad k a).
Differentiating, we see that the infinitesimal action of ξ : Σ → k on A is −d A ξ. (e) (Complex gauge transformations) The complexified gauge group G(P ) consists of sections g : Σ → P × K G. Recall that
(2) K × k → G, (k, s) → ke is
is an isomorphism. So, a complex gauge transformation g can be written as g = ke iξ , where k ∈ K(P ) and ξ ∈ Lie(K(P )) = Γ(P (k)).

Remark 2.2. (Action of complex gauge transformations on connections) The action of K(P ) on the space of connections extends to an action of G(P ). To see this, we assume for the time being that K = U (n) for some n. Consider the vector bundle E = P × U (n) C n equipped with the Hermitian metric induced by the invariant Hermitian metric on C n . Let C(E) denote the space of complex structures on E. Given a connection A ∈ A(P ), let ∂ A := π 0,1 • d A . Since the base manifold Σ is twodimensional, ∂ 2 A = 0 and so ∂ A determines a complex structure on E. Conversely, given a holomorphic structure on E, there is a unique connection compatible with that and the Hermitian metric (see [14]). This shows that there is a bijection between A(P ) and C(E). Now, suppose K ⊆ U (n) for some n. Infinitesimally, this gives an isomorphism
T A A = Ω 1 (Σ, k) → T C C = Ω 0,1 (Σ, g), a → a 0,1 .
The complex structure on C pulls back to a complex structure on A given by J A a = a • j Σ = * a. The action of the complexified gauge group on C pulls back to one on A. For any ξ ∈ k(P ), the infinitesimal action of iξ on A is − * d A ξ. Now consider a general compact Lie group K. For some n, there is an injection K ⊆ U (n). The K-connections can be seen as a subspace of the U (n)-connections. The action of G(P ) preserves K-connections, because for ξ ∈ k(P ), the infinitesimal action of iξ
on A is d A ξ • j Σ which is in Ω 1 (Σ, k).
A connection A determines a holomorphic structure on any associated bundle of P , whose fiber is a complex manifold. One such example is P (X) = P × K X. Let us call this complex structure ∂ A .
Definition 2.3.
(a) (Gauged holomorphic maps) A gauged holomorphic map (A, u) from P to X consists of a connection A and a section u of P (X) that is holomorphic with respect to ∂ A . The space of gauged holomorphic maps from P to X is called H(P, X). (b) (Symplectic vortices) A symplectic vortex is a gauged holomorphic map that satisfies
* F A + Φ(u) = 0.
(c) (Energy) ω Σ ∈ Ω 2 (Σ), determining a metric on Σ. The energy of a gauged holomorphic map (A, u) is
E(A, u) := Σ (|F A | 2 + |d A u| 2 + |Φ • u| 2 )ω Σ .
In the literature, the energy map E is also called the Yang-Mills-Higgs functional. For Σ = C, finite energy symplectic vortices have good asymptotic properties (see [13] section 11, [35]).

Remark 2.4. (Holomorphicity condition in the case of a trivial bundle) When P is the trivial bundle Σ × K, the section u is a map u : Σ → X. The formula for the covariant derivative on P (X) becomes
d A u = du + a u ∈ Ω 1 (Σ, u * T X).
Here A = d + a and a u is the infinitesimal action of a on u -i.e. for any x ∈ Σ, a u (x) = a(x) u(x) . Then, ∂ A u = ∂u + a 0,1 u . The complexified gauge group acts on H(P, X) pairwise:
g : (A, u) → (g(A), gu) = ((g −1 ) * A, gu).
It can be verified that this action preserves holomorphicity (see [29]).

The following observation will be useful. We first describe principal bundles on P(1, n) and connections on them. We take a unitary viewpoint in this section, as opposed to a holomorphic one (see remark 2.8). For orbifolds, we follow classical definitions [25]. Gauged holomorphic maps on orbifolds are similar to J-holomorphic curves on orbifolds described in [6]. We will not repeat full definitions here, but just describe what the definitions give in the specific case that the orbifold is P(1, n). Definition 2.6.

(a) (Weighted projective line) The weighted projective space P(1, n) is the quotient of C 2 − {0} by the action of C × with weights 1, n. It is covered by two orbifold charts,Ũ 1 and U 2 whereŨ 1 = U 2 = C and the equivalences are :
z ∼ e 2πi/n z z ∈Ũ 1 z −n ∼ w 0 = w ∈ U 2 , 0 = z ∈Ũ 1
We refer toŨ 1 / ∼ as U 1 . (b) (Clutching construction) We next describe a principal K-bundle P → P(1, n).

LetP |Ũ 1 denote the lift of P | U 1 toŨ 1 . P is given by trivializationsP
|Ũ 1 ≃ U 1 × K and P | U 2 ≃ U 2 × K under the equivalences (z, h) ∼ (e 2πi/n z, µ(z)h) (z, h) ∈Ũ 1 × K (z, h) ∼ (w, τ (z)h) 0 = z ∈Ũ 1 , w ∈ U 2 , w = 1 z n , h ∈ K(3)
where µ :Ũ 1 → K defines a Z n -action onŨ 1 × K and and τ :Ũ 1 \{0} → K satisfies τ (e 2πi/n z) = τ (z)µ(z) −1 . Note that the fiber over the singular point 0 ∈Ũ 1 may not be K, it could just be K/Z n (c) (Clutching construction for connections) Let σ n :Ũ 1 →Ũ 1 , z → e 2πi/n z denote the diffeomorphism giving the action of the generator of Z n . A connection on P → P(1, n) is given by connections on trivializationsŨ 1 × K and U 2 × K that satisfy the equivalences (3):

(i) A|Ũ 1 satisfies σ * n A = µ(A) (viewing µ as a gauge transformation). (ii) By the above condition, σ * n (τ (A)) = τ (A) onŨ 1 \{0}, so it descends to a connection onŨ 1 \{0}/Z n . We require that this descended connection is A| U 2 \{0} . (d) (Clutching construction for gauge transformations) A gauge transformation k on P consists ofk 1 = k|Ũ 1 :Ũ 1 → K and k 2 = k| U 2 :
U 2 → K satisfying the equivalences (3) - (i) σ * n k 1 = µk 1 µ −1 and (ii) τ k 1 |Ũ 1 \{0} τ −1 descends to k 2 .
Unless, otherwise mentioned, we think of P(1, n) as C with an orbifold singularity at ∞. More precisely, the orbifold point is the quotient P(n) of C * by C * acting with weight n. As a groupoid this is equivalent to the quotient of a point by Z n , that is, BZ n . Definition 2.7. (Gauged holomorphic maps from the weighted projective line) Let P → P(1, n). A gauged holomorphic map (A, u) from P(1, n) to X consists of gauged holomorphic maps on the bundlesŨ 1 × K and U 2 × K that satisfy the equivalence conditions (3) (a) (A, u)|Ũ 1 satisfies σ * n (A, u) = µ(A, u) (viewing µ as a gauge transformation). (b) By the above condition, σ * n (τ (A, u)) = τ (A, u) onŨ 1 \{0}, so it descends to a gauged holomorphic map onŨ 1 \{0}/Z n . We require that this descended map is (A, u)| U 2 \{0} . Remark 2.8. (Holomorphic viewpoint) A gauged holomorphic map (A, u) can be described by the following data :

(a) A G-equivariant holomorphic map u : P C → X, where P C = P × K G and its holomorphic structure is given by A (b) and a section σ : Σ → P C /K.

The complex gauge equivalence class of (A, u) is specified by the map u, that is, does not depend on σ. Holomorphic bundles on P(1, n) can be described in a similar way to the unitary bundles, the only difference is that the transition functions µ :Ũ 1 → G and τ :Ũ 1 \{0} → G will be holomorphic maps. Another observation is that any holomorphic principal bundle over C is trivial (see remark 19.6 in [8]). So, a gauged holomorphic map can just be specified by u :Ũ 1 , U 2 → X and the transition functions τ and λ. Definition 2.9. (Weak gauge transformations and gauged holomorphic maps) Fix p > 2. We call a gauged holomorphic map (A, u) on P → P(1, n) weak if it is smooth on C and on BR ⊂Ũ 1 , which is a neighbourhood of ∞, (A, u)| BR ∈ L p × W 1,p . A (complex) gauge transformation on P is weakly extendable if it is smooth on C and in W 1,p in a neighbourhood of ∞. Denote by G(P ) we the group of weakly extendable gauge transformations.

By the Sobolev embedding theorem, any weakly extendable (A, u) resp. g is continuous and so u(∞) resp. g(∞) is well-defined. The following is the analytic version of the main result of the paper. Theorem 2.10. Suppose X is Kähler manifold with Hamiltonian action of a compact Lie group K, which is either compact or a finite dimensional vector space with the linear action of K and a proper moment map. Let G be the complexification of K, and suppose G acts locally freely on X ss . Let n be an integer such that for any x ∈ X ss , |G x | divides n. Fix p > 2.

Let (A, u) be a gauged holomorphic map from C to X that extends to a map over some principal bundle P → P(1, n), and suppose u(∞) ∈ X ss . There is a weakly extendable complex gauge transformation g ∈ G(P ) we such that g(A, u) is a smooth finite energy symplectic vortex, which is unique up to left multiplication by a unitary gauge transformation.

Conversely, given any finite energy symplectic vortex, there is a K-bundle P → P(1, n) so that (A, u) extends to a weak gauged holomorphic map on P . There is a weakly extendable complex gauge transformation g ∈ G(P ) so that g(A, u) is smooth over P(1, n). The gauged holomorphic map g(A, u) is unique up to complex gauge transformations in G(P ).


Gauged holomorphic maps as maps between stacks

In the first three subsections of this section, we provide background and define stacks over the category of manifolds, following [19]. In the last subsection we show how the space of gauged holomorphic map from P(1, n) can be viewed as functors between stacks. This is used to observe to derive theorem 1.1 from the main theorem 2.10.
Definition 3.1.
(a) (CFG's) A category fibered in groupoids (CFG) over a category C is a functor π : D → C such that (i) Given an arrow f : ξ ′ → ξ in C and an objectξ ∈ D with π(ξ) = ξ there is an arrowf :ξ ′ →ξ in D with π(f ) = f (we say thatξ ′ is the pullback is the pullback ofξ along f ).

(ii) Given a diagram
ξ ′′ f ? ? ? ξ ′ h ? ? ξ in D and a diagram π(ξ ′′ ) g π(f ) ? ? π(ξ ′ ) π(h) ? ? π(ξ) in C there is a unique arrowg : ξ ′′ → ξ ′ in D making ξ ′′ f ? ? ? g ξ ′ h ? ?
ξ commute and satisfying π(g) = g.

(b) (Fibers of a CFG) For any C ∈ Ob(C), the fiber over C is the subcategory D(C) with objects Ob(D(C)) := {ξ ∈ Ob(D) : π(ξ) = C} and morphisms in Ob(D(C)) that project to Id C under π.

Remark 3.2. We summarize some results about CFGs, for details, see [19].

(a) Any two pullbacks ofξ ∈ Ob(D) along f ∈ Mor(C) are isomorphic.
(b) For any C ∈ Ob(C), D(C) is a groupoid. (c)
The collection of all categories fibered in groupoids over the category C is a 2-category. The 1-morphisms between CFGs π D : D → C and π E : E → C are maps
F : D → E that satisfy π E • F = π D .
Given two 1-morphism F, F ′ : D → E, a 2-morphisms α : F =⇒ F ′ is a natural transformation between them. Since E(C) is a groupoid, any natural transformation is invertible.

In order to define stacks, we need the concept of a descent category. Let Man denote the category of manifolds with morphisms being smooth maps. 
{U i → M }) is ({ξ i }, {φ ij }), where ξ i ∈ Ob(D(U i )), and φ ij : pr * 2 ξ j ≃ pr * 1 ξ i is an isomorphism in D(U ij ) = D(U i × M U j )
, such that the following cocycle condition is satisfied: for any triple of indices i, j and k, we have the equality
pr * 13 φ ik = pr * 12 φ ij • pr * 23 φ jk : pr * 3 ξ k → pr * 1 ξ i
where the pr ab and pr a are projections to the ath and the bth component, and to the ath component respectively. (For example, pr 13 : U ijk → U ik and pr 2 :
U ijk → U j .) The isomorphisms φ ij are called transition isomorphisms. (b) An arrow {α i } ∈ Mor(D({U i → M })) between objects ({ξ i }, {φ ij }), ({η i }, {ψ ij }) ∈ Ob(D({U i → M })) is the collection of arrows α i : ξ i → η i in D(U i ),
with the property that for each pair of indices i, j, the diagram   Morphisms from Y 1
pr * 2 ξ j pr * 2 α j / / φ ij pr * 2 η j ψ ij pr * 1 ξ i pr * 1 α i / / pr * 1 η i commutes.f 1 → M to Y 2 f 2 → M are smooth maps φ : Y 1 → Y 2 such that f 2 φ = f 1 . The projection π : M → Man is the forgetful functor that maps Y f → M to Y . It can be seen that a functor M → N is determined by a map M → N .
Definition 3.6. (Fiber products) Let π X : X → C, π Y : Y → C and π Z : Z → C be three categories fibered in groupoids over a category C.
The 2-fiber product Z × X Y of the diagram Y f Z g / / X is the category with objects (Z × X Y ) 0 = (y, z, α) ∈ Y 0 × Z 0 × X 1 | π Y (y) = π Z (z), f (y) α → g(z)
and morphisms
Hom Z× X Y (z 1 , y 1 , α 1 ), (z 2 , y 2 , α 2 ) =        (z 1 v → z 2 , y 1 u → y 2 ) π Y (u) = π Z (v) ∈ C 1 , f (y 1 ) f (u) / / α 1 f (y 2 ) α 2 g(z 1 ) g(v) / / g(z 2 ) ∈ X 1        together with the functor π : Z × X Y → C defined by π((z, y, α)) = π Z (z) = π Y (y), π(v, u) = π Z (v) = π Y (u) Remark 3.7. The diagram Z × X Y Z Y X pr 2 / / pr 1 g f / /
does not commute. But there is a natural isomorphism g • pr 2 ⇒ f • pr 1 which need not be the identity.

From now on, to simplify notation, we denote M just by M . We also drop the distinction between a manifold and the stack induced by it. (b) (Groupoids associated to atlases) Given an atlas p : X → D, we can define a Lie groupoid G by Ob(G) := X and Mor(G) := X × D X, which is also a manifold. The source and target maps s, t : Mor(G) → Ob(G) are given by projection X × D X → X to the first and second factor respectively. For any Lie groupoid G, there is a category BG, with objects principal G-bundles (see [19] for a definition. If G is a Lie group, this coincides with the regular notion of principal bundle) and morphisms G-equivariant maps. Define a CFG π : BG → Man, where any principle bundle is sent to its base space and the morphisms are sent to their projection on the base spaces. BG → Man is a stack and it is isomorphic to X as a stack. (c) (Orbifolds) A stack D is Deligne-Mumford if it admits an atlas X → D so that the corresponding groupoid G is proper andétale, i.e. source and target maps s and t are proper local diffeomorphisms. An orbifold is a Deligne-Mumford stack (in the category of manifolds). In our example P(1, n), G 0 = C C and G 1 corresponds to the equivalences (3).

Definition 3.9. (Quotient stacks) Let X be a manifold on which a Lie group G acts holomorphically. The quotient stack X/G is defined as: The following is standard: Proposition 3.10. Suppose that G acts locally freely and properly on X. Then the quotient stack X/G admits the structure of an orbifold.
(a) The objects of X/G are {P → M, P f → X}, P is a principal G-bundle over manifold M and f is G-equivariant. (b) An arrow between {P 1 → M 1 , P 1 f 1 → X} and {P 2 → M 2 , P 2 f 2 → X} is a G-equivariant map h : P 1 → P 2 such that f 1 = f 2 • h.
We may also work in the category Man C whose objects are complex manifolds and whose morphisms holomorphic maps. All the previous definitions are the same, but with holomorphic maps instead of smooth maps. In particular, (a) a complex orbifold is a Deligne-Mumford stack over Man C ; and (b) if G is a complex Lie group acting on a complex manifold X then the quotient stack X/G is the category of pairs (P, u) where P → M is a holomorphic bundle and u : M → P (X) is a holomorphic section.

From now on, all our stacks are over Man C . We may now re-interpret our definition of gauged holomorphic map from Definition 2.3 in stack language.

Proposition 3.11. The set of gauged holomorphic maps from P(1, n) to X modulo complex gauge transformations is in bijection with isomorphism classes of objects of Hom(P(1, n), X/G).

We will prove this after recalling the following version of the Yoneda lemma: Lemma 3.12 (2-Yoneda : [19] Lemma 4.19). Let D → C be a category fibered in groupoids (CFG). For any object X ∈ C, there is an equivalence of categories
Θ : Hom CF G (X, D) → D(X).(4)
Hom CF G (X, D) denotes the category of maps of CFGs and natural transformations between them.

Proof of proposition 3.11. Lemma 3.12 proves proposition 3.11 in the case n = 1: Hom(P 1 , X/G) is equivalent to X/G(P 1 ). The objects in the fiber X/G(P 1 ) are
{P → P 1 , P f → X} where P is a holomorphic G-bundle and f is G-equivariant. The morphisms between {P 1 → P 1 , P 1 f 1 → X} and {P 2 → P 1 , P 2 f 2 → X} are isomorphisms
and they consist of G-equivariant holomorphic maps between principal bundles P 1 h → P 2 that satisfy u 2 • h = u 1 and are identity on the base P 1 . These morphisms are precisely complex gauge transformations that take (P 1 , u 1 ) to (P 2 , u 2 ).

For the general case, consider u ∈ Hom(P(1, n), X/G). The pairŨ 1 , U 2 described in 2.6 is an atlas for P(1, n) making it anétale Lie groupoid H, and hence a Deligne-Mumford stack. In the space of morphisms Mor(H) in the groupoid H, one of the components is H 1
1 = {(x, σ n x) : x ∈Ũ 1 }.
By pulling back, we have u :Ũ 1 → X/G.
H 1 1 ⊂Ũ 1 × P(1,n)Ũ1 pr 2 pr 1 / /Ũ 1 f U 1 g / / P(1, n)
The pull-backs (g • pr 2 ) * ξ and (f • pr 1 ) * ξ are related by a natural isomorphism, this means there is a µ :
Ũ 1 → G that satisfies u(σ n x) = µ(x)u(x)(5)
for all x ∈Ũ 1 . Since u is holomorphic, µ is also holomorphic.
Another component of Mor(H) is H 2 1 = {(z, w) ∈Ũ 1 × U 2 : w = 1 z n }.
In a similar way that leads to a transition map τ :
Ũ 1 \{0} → G that satisfies τ u(z) = u(w),(6)
where z ∈Ũ 1 , w ∈ U 2 and w = 1 z n . Since u|Ũ 1 and u| U 2 are holomorphic, τ is also holomorphic. Equations (5) and (6) imply that τ • σ n = τ µ −1 . This shows that u ∈ Hom(P(1, n), X/G) corresponds to a gauged holomorphic map from P(1, n) to X. It's easy to see the reverse is true: given a gauged holomorphic map from P(1, n) to X, we get an element in Hom(P(1, n), X/G). Complex gauge transformations correspond to natural isomorphisms between functors in Hom(P(1, n), X, G). Proposition 3.11 shows that theorem 2.10 yields theorem 1.1.


Heat flow for vector space target

In this section we extend the Hitchin-Kobayashi correspondence of [29] to the case of non-compact target. We recall the main result of [29]. If s, p are positive integers such that s − 1 p ≥ 0, we denote by W s,p δ (Ω) = {f ∈ W s,p (Ω) : f | ∂Ω = 0} the Sobolev space vanishing on the boundary. In this section, we extend this result to the case when X = C n , the group action is linear and the moment map is proper. Suppose K acts via a group homomorphism ρ : K → U (n). A moment map for the action is
Φ(x) := (dρ) * − ι 2 xx * + τ
Here dρ : k → u(n) is the differential of ρ at Id, and (dρ) * is its dual with respect to the chosen Ad-invariant inner product on k and the inner product A, B = tr(A * B) on u(n). The element τ ∈ k is a central element chosen such that K acts locally freely on Φ −1 (0).

In [29], theorem 4.1 is proved by showing the long-term existence of gradient flow of (A, u) under the functional (A, u) → * F A + Φ(u) L 2 (Σ) . As t → ∞, the gradient flow converges modulo gauge to a symplectic vortex. All the results assume that the target X is compact.
Lemma 4.2.
Suppose Σ is a compact Riemann surface (possibly with boundary), X = C n with G acting linearly. We assume the moment map Φ is proper. Let (A, u) be a gauged holomorphic curve on Σ with the energy bound E(A, u) ≤ k. Then, there is a compact set S ⊆ C n , determined only by k, that contains u(Σ).

Proof of lemma 4.2. Define an operator L x for every x ∈ X,
(7) L x : k → T X X, ξ → ξ X (x)
So, given u : Σ → X, we obtain a section
L u ∈ Γ(Σ, Hom(k, T u X))
of the vector bundle Hom(k, T u X) on Σ.

Step 1: Proof of lemma assuming that ∂Σ = φ. By the energy bound, F (A) L 2 , Φ(u) L 2 < k. Using Uhlenbeck's local theorem ( [28]), we can find a cover of Σ, ∪ α U α and local trivializations under which the connection A is d+ a α on U α and a α H 1 (Uα) < c k . Here c k is a constant depending only on k. Suppose, under this trivialization u is given by u α : U α → C n . Holomorphicity yields ∂u α = (a α ) 0,1 uα . The lemma is proved by using elliptic regularity to obtain a C 0 bound on each u α . First we produce an L 2 bound on each u α . Since Φ is a quadratic function on X and is proper, we have
u L 2 < c(1 + Φ(u) L 2 ) < c k .
Note that (a α ) uα is the product of two sections L uα ∈ Γ(Σ, End(k, T uα X)) and
a α ∈ Γ(Σ, k). |L x | grows linearly with x, so |L x | ≈ c|Φ(x)| 1/2 . Since Φ(u α ) L 2 < k, L uα L 4 < c k . By the multiplication theorem (proposition A.5), (a α ) uα L 2+ǫ (Uα) < c k . Let U ′′ α ⋐ U ′ α ⋐ U α be such that U ′′ α still cover Σ.
We apply interior elliptic regularity twice to obtain
u α W 1,2 (U ′ α ) ≤ c( ∂u α L 2 (Uα) + u α L 2 (Uα) ) ≤ c k .
By Sobolev embedding, W 1,2 ֒→ L 2+ǫ and so, the L 2+ǫ norms of u α are bounded by c k . Next,
u α W 1,2+ǫ (U ′′ α ) ≤ c( ∂u α L 2+ǫ (U ′ α ) + u α L 2+ǫ (U ′ α ) ) ≤ c k . By the inclusion W 1,2+ǫ ֒→ C 0 , u α (U α ) is contained in a compact set S α ⊆ C n .
We can replace S α by KS α , which is also compact. In this way we see the compact set is independent of the trivialization we choose over U α .

Step 2: When ∂Σ = φ.

We use a technique from the proof of lemma 4.2.6 in [29] to construct a gauged holomorphic map on a closed Riemann surfaceΣ that is made up of two copies of Σ. For ease of notation, we assume throughout the proof that ∂Σ has one component, the proof works identically for multiple components.

Assume that B ǫ (∂Σ) is the ǫ-neighbourhood of ∂Σ, parametrized by {z ∈ C : 1 ≤ |z| < 1 + ǫ}. There is a trivialization
τ : P | Bǫ(∂σ) → {z ∈ C : 1 ≤ |z| < 1 + ǫ} × K, under which A is in radial gauge, i.e. (τ −1 1 ) * A = d + a θ dθ. Consider the bundlẽ P := P P /{(x, x) : x ∈ P ∂Σ } over the Riemann surfaceΣ := Σ Σ/{(x, x) : x ∈ ∂Σ}.
At the boundary, the trivialization τ of P | Bǫ(∂Σ) extends to a trivialization ofP :
P | Bǫ(∂Σ) ≃ z ∈ C 1 1 + ǫ < |z| < 1 + ǫ × K.
This defines the manifold structure ofP close to ∂Σ. Next, the connectionÃ oñ P be given by the A on both copies of P . The trace of these connections on P | ∂Σ agree, so this is a H 1 connection onP .ũ :Σ → X is defined to be same as u on both copies. Finally, we note that Step 1 applies if (A, u) is in the space
H 1 ×(H 1 loc ∩C 0 loc ), and E(Ã,ũ) = 2E(A, u) ≤ 2k.
Step 1 impliesũ(Σ) is contained in a compact set of X, and so the same holds for u.

Lemma 4.2.6 in [29] tells us that if (A t , u t ) is the gradient flow line of the functional
* F A + Φ(u) 2 L 2 (Σ) for t ∈ [0, T ], then E(A t , u t ) decreases with t.
Along with the above lemma this implies that if the gradient flow exists till time t, u t (Σ) ⊆ S. So, we may assume that the target manifold is S. Therefore the flow exists for all time. We have proved: Proposition 4.3. Theorem 4.1 holds in the case when X = C n , the action of K is linear and the moment map Φ is proper.


From a holomorphic map to a vortex: outside a compact set

In this section we find a complex gauge transformation so that the vortex equation is satisfied outside of a ball. That is, Proposition 5.1. Suppose the action of G on X ss has finite stabilizers. Let (A, u) be a gauged holomorphic map from C to X that extends to one over a principal bundle P → P(1, n), and suppose u(∞) ∈ X ss . Then there exists a smooth function s : C → k such that if e is : C → G denotes the gauge transformation obtained by exponentiating is then e is (A, u) is a finite energy vortex on C\B R for some R. The gauge transformation e is extends continuously to a complex gauge transformation on P → P(1, n).

Definition 5.2. We define the following natural covering spaces of C\B R . For any R > 0, letΣ R := C\B R 1/n be the n-fold cover of Σ R , with covering map z → z n . Let
Σ R = {re iθ : r ≥ R, θ ∈ R/2nπZ}
be the isometric n-fold cover of Σ R with covering map is re iθ → re i(θ mod 2π) .

The metrics differ onΣ R and Σ R as follows. Let τ :Σ R → Σ R be the obvious map that commutes with the covering maps. Let ωΣ R and ω Σ R be the Euclidean Kähler form on these spaces. Then, τ * ω Σ R = n 2 r 2n−2 ωΣ R . The L 2 norms transform as follows
α ∈ Ω 0 (Σ R ) Σ R |α| 2 ω Σ R = Σ R |τ * α| 2 n 2 r 2n−2 ωΣ R α ∈ Ω 1 (Σ R ) Σ R |α| 2 ω Σ R = Σ R |τ * α| 2 ωΣ R α ∈ Ω 2 (Σ R ) Σ R |α| 2 ω Σ R = Σ R |τ * α| 2 n −2 r −2n+2 ωΣ R(8)
At the center of the proof of proposition 5.1 is an implicit function theorem argument. This is part of the following proposition. Proposition 5.3. Let R 0 > 0 and (A, u) be a gauged holomorphic map over Σ R 0 . We assume the following:
(a) * F A + Φ(u) L 2 < ∞; (b) u extends continuously over ∞, i.e there is a point u(∞) ∈ Φ −1 (0) so that lim r→∞ u(re iθ ) = u ∞ for all θ ∈ [0, 2nπ); and (c) on the trivial bundle Σ R 0 ×K, A = d+a, a ∈ Ω 1 (Σ R 0 , k) satisfies a H 1 < ∞.
Then, there exists R ≥ R 0 for which there is a complex gauge transformation g ∈ H 2 (Σ R , G) so that g(A, u) is a finite energy vortex on Σ R . In addition, suppose (A, u) satisfies the symmetry relation (A, u)(e 2πi ·) = γ(A, u), where γ ∈ K and γ n = Id, then, g satisfies (9) g(e 2πi ·) = γg(·)γ −1 .

We remark that it is enough to look for a complex gauge transformation of the form g = e iξ . This is because any complex gauge transformation g can be written as g = ke iξ , where k ∈ K and ξ ∈ Lie(K), and if g(A, u) is a symplectic vortex, so is e iξ (A, u).

Proof of proposition 5.3. Define the functional
F R : Γ(C\B R , g) → Γ(C\B R , g), ξ → * F (exp iξ)A,(exp iξ)u .
The linearization at ξ DF R ξ (ξ 1 ) = d * (exp iξ)D d (exp iξ)D ξ 1 + u * dΦ(J(ξ 1 ) u ) extends to a map between Sobolev completions: g). The Sobolev norm for the spaces H s R := H s (C\B R , g) is defined in the usual way:
DF R ξ : H 2 (C\B R , g) → L 2 (C\B R ,σ s := s i=0 ∇ i σ 2 L 2 (C\B R ) 1/2
where ∇ is the trivial connection.

The proof of the theorem proceeds by showing that
DF R 0 : ξ 1 → d * dξ 1 + u * dΦ(J(ξ 1 ) u ) is onto, since it is 'close' to d * d + Id.
Then we'll apply the implicit function theorem to find a solution for F R = 0 close to ξ = 0. For notational convenience, we define an operator L x for every x ∈ X,
L x : g → g, ξ → dΦ x (Jξ x )
If K acts locally freely at x, then L x is a positive operator.

For proving the symmetry result (9) we define the operator τ γ : Γ(Σ, k) → Γ(Σ, k), ξ → Ad γ −1 ξ(e 2πi ·).

Step 1: There exists R 1 such that for R ≥ R 1 , DF R (0) : H 2 R → L 2 R is onto and has a right inverse Q R , with Q R < C and C is independent of R. If 
(A, u)(e 2πi ·) = γ(A, u), then Q R can be chosen so that Im Q R is invariant under τ γ . Write (10) DF 0 = d * A d A + L u = (d * d + L u(∞) ) + (d * A d A − d * d) + (L u − L u(∞) ) We first show that (d * d + L u(∞) ) isd * d + L u | L i = d * d + λ i . We now choose a right inverse q R for d * d + Id : H 2 (C\B R , C) → L 2 (C\B R , C). Given σ ∈ L 2 R , extend it by 0 in B R to getσ ∈ L 2 (C\B 1 , C). By proposition A.1, (Id +d * d) : H 2 δ (C\B 1 , C) → L 2 (C\B 1 , C) is invertible where H 2 δ (Ω) := {f ∈ H 2 (Ω) : f | ∂Ω = 0}
. Let r R denote restriction of a function from C\B 1 to C\B R . Define as
q R (σ) = r R (Id +d * d) −1σ .
Then q R < k and k is independent of R. By scaling, we can obtain a right inverse for d * d + λ i also. So, d * d + L u(∞) : W 2,p R → L p R has a right inverseQ R with norm bounded by k/λ, where λ := min{1, λ 1 , . . . , λ m }.

Next, we look at the perturbative terms. We can write
(d * A d A − d * d)ξ = * [a ∧ * dξ] + [d * a ∧ ξ] + * [a ∧ * [a ∧ ξ]]. By the Sobolev multiplication theorem (proposition A.5), * [a ∧ * dξ] + [d * a ∧ ξ] + * [a ∧ * [a ∧ ξ]] L 2 R ≤ c( a H 1 R + a 2 H 1 R ) ξ H 2 R ≤ λ 4k ξ H 2 R for small a H 1 R
, which can be achieved by taking R large. Consider L u − L u(∞) . As R → ∞, u(Re iθ ) → u(∞) uniformly and so L u − L ∞ C 0 (C\B R ) → 0. For large R,
L u − L ∞ C 0 (C\B R ) < λ/4k.
And hence, the operator L u − L ∞ : H 2 R → L 2 R has norm λ/4k. So, for a suitable R 1 ,
(d * A d A − d * d) + (L u − L u(∞) ) ≤ λ/2k ≤ 1 2 Q R for all R ≥ R 1 . So, for R ≥ R 1 , dF R (0) : ImQ R → L 2
R is an isomorphism with the norm of the inverse bounded by 2 Q R ≤ 2k/λ.

To prove symmetry, assume (A, u)(e 2πi ·) = γ(A, u). Since Im Q R = ImQ R , it is enough to make ImQ R invariant under τ γ . IfQ R is a right inverse of d * d + L u(∞) , since u(∞) is fixed by γ, τ γ •Q R is also a right inverse. And, since d * d + L u(∞) is a linear operator, we can replaceQ R by its average under τ γ , given by 1 n n−1 i=0 τ i γ •Q R . The bound on the norm changes by a constant.

Step 2: There is a constant δ > 0 such that for ξ 2,p < δ,
DF R ξ − DF R 0 ≤ 1 2C (C is the constant in Step 1) Write DF R ξ − DF R 0 = (d * (exp iξ)A d (exp iξ)A − d * A d A ) + (L (exp iξ)u − L u ) Consider the first term. Let (exp iξ)A = A + a. Then, (d * (exp iξ)A d (exp iξ)A − d * A d A )ξ 1 = * [a ∧ * dξ 1 ] + d * [a ∧ ξ 1 ] + * [a ∧ * [a ∧ ξ 1 ]
]. The multiplication theorem on Euclidean domains (proposition A.5) is bounded by constants independent of the domain (it depends only on the Sobolev exponents). So,
(d * (exp iξ)A d (exp iξ)A − d * A d A )ξ 1 L 2 ≤ c a H 1 ξ 1 H 2 ≤ c ξ 1 H 2 ξ H 2 ,
where the last inequality is by lemma 5.4. The constant c then depends on a 0 H 1 (Σ) , where A = d + a 0 -a 0 H 1 (Σ R ) can be bounded above if R ≥ R 1 and so c is Rindependent.

The next term ξ → (L (exp iξ)u − L u ) is a smooth map. There is an L ∞ bound on its derivative, since u(C\B R 0 ) is compact. Hence
L (exp iξ)u − L u C 0 < c ξ C 0 < c ξ H 2 .
By the Sobolev multiplication theorem,
(L (exp iξ)u − L u )ξ 1 L 2 ≤ c ξ H 2 ξ 1 H 2 . So, DF R ξ − DF R 0 ≤ c ξ H 2 . For a small enough δ > 0, ξ H 2 < δ =⇒ DF R ξ − DF R 0 ≤ 1 2C .
Step 3: Finishing the proof To finish the proof of proposition 5.3, we apply the implicit function theorem (proposition A.4) on F, with the values of δ and C found in the previous step. We assume that R is larger than the R 1 in Step 1. We need to ensure that
F(0) L 2 < δ 4C .
This can be done by taking a large enough value of R, since * F A + Φ(u) L 2 < ∞.

To prove the symmetry result (9) suppose ξ is the solution produced by the implicit function theorem. Then it is a unique solution in B δ (H 2 (Σ, k)) ∩ Im Q R .

But, by the symmetry of (A, u), τ γ ξ is also a solution in B δ and it is in Im Q R . So, ξ = τ γ ξ.

The following lemma was used in the proof of proposition 5.3.

Lemma 5.4 (Norm bound for G C action on A). Let R > 0, and let A = d + a be a connection on the bundle (C\B R ) × K for which a H 1 (C\B R ) < ǫ. For any
ξ ∈ H 2 (C\B R , k) satisfying ξ H 2 < 1, (exp iξ)A ∈ H 1 and there is a constant C(ǫ) so that (exp iξ)A − A H 1 (C\B R ) ≤ C ξ H 2 (C\B R ) . Proof. The infinitesimal action of iξ on a connection A is * d A ξ. Suppose a t : [0, 1] → H 1 A (k) is the solution of the ODE da t dt = * d A+at ξ = * d A ξ + * [a t ∧ ξ], a 0 = a. Then, (exp iξ)A = A + a 1 . d dt a t H 1 ≤ da t dt H 1 ≤ c( ξ H 2 + a t H 1 ξ H 2 ) ≤ c(1 + a t H 1 ), since ξ H 2 < 1. The constant c depends on the norm of d A : H 2 → H 1 . Now, for any t, a t < c, which implies d dt a t H 1 ≤ c ξ H 2 .
This proves the result.

We identify the complement of the orbifold point with C, and let B R denote an open ball of radius R around 0. The next two technical lemmas show that we can assume that a pair (A, u) is in standard form near infinity.


Proposition 5.5. (Standard form near infinity for orbifold connections) Suppose

A is a connection on P → P(1, n). There is a complex gauge transformation g on P , and a trivialization of P over C so that gA| C = d + λdθ on C\B R for some R > 0, λ ∈ k satisfying e 2πnλ = Id. Conversely, if A is a connection on C satisfying the above condition, then it extends to a connection on a principal bundle over P(1, n).

Proof. Pick an R 1 > 0 and consider B R 1 ⊆Ũ 1 . By, for example, theorem 1 in Donaldson [12], there is a unique complex gauge transformation e is , s : B R 1 → k, s| ∂B R 1 = 0, so that e is A is a flat connection. and the complex gauge transformation e is is unique up to multiplication by elements in K(B R 1 ). Notice that (σ * n e is )µ also transforms A to a flat connection. So, there is a gauge transformation k :
B R 1 → K so that ke is = (σ * n e is )µ. Writing (σ * n e is )µ = µe i Ad −1 µ (s•σn) ,
we see that s • σ n = Ad µ s. Let η :Ũ 1 → [0, 1] be a radially symmetric cut-off function that is 1 on B R and vanishes onŨ 1 \B 2R 1 . It is easy to see that e iηs defines a complex gauge transformation g on all of P(1, n).

Now, we switch to working on U 2 . Let R = (2R 1 ) −n . Choose a trivialization P | U 2 → U 2 × G so that gA is in radial gauge outside B R , and since gA is flat, gA = d + a(θ)dθ, for some a : S 1 → k.

Claim. Let A 1 be a connection on C × K that is equal to d + a(θ)dθ on C\B R , where a : S 1 → k. There is a λ ∈ k such that A 1 is gauge equivalent to a connection that is equal to d + λdθ on C\B R .

Proof. Let k : [0, 2π] → K be the solution of
k −1 dk dθ = a(θ), k(0) = Id .
The path θ → k(θ) can be homotoped to a geodesic θ → e λθ , λ ∈ k. Then, e λθ k −1 is a gauge transformation on C\B R that is homotopic to the identity and it transforms A 1 to d + λdθ on C\B R . By using a cut-off function, e λθ k −1 can be extended to a gauge transformation on all of C.


By this claim, g(A)

is gauge-equivalent to a connection that is d + λdθ on C\B R . Its holonomy about infinity is e 2πλ . Since g(A) has trivial holonomy for loops close to 0 inŨ 1 , we have e 2πnλ = Id.

For the converse, we construct a bundle P → P(1, n). Set µ = e −2πλ and τ = e nλθ . We are given A| U 2 . A|Ũ 1 can be constructed using the transition function τ . A|Ũ 1 will be trivial on B R −n ⊆Ũ 1 .

Remark 5.6. (a) (Choice of n) Given a connection A on C × K of the form mentioned in the above proposition, i.e. A = d + λdθ on C\B R with e 2πλn = Id. We can extend A to a connection on principal bundles not just over P(1, n), but also P(1, mn) for any positive integer m. (b) (Choice of λ) Topologically, the set of principal K-bundles P → P 1 is π 1 (K).

This can be seen as follows : the deformation retract of the transition map C * → K is a loop S 1 → K, whose homotopy type determines the bundle. The loop S 1 → K can be deformed to a geodesic loop θ → e λθ , where λ ∈ k satisfies e 2πλ = Id. Given a bundle P → P(1, n), the transition maps would now produce a geodesic path θ ∈ [0, 2π] → e λθ , λ ∈ k satisfies e 2πnλ = Id. The bundle P is not altered by deforming the path θ → e λθ (keeping the endpoints Id and e 2πλ fixed) or by applying Ad k to the path for some k ∈ K. In the lemma above, this classifying path is θ → e λθ . In the claim, we observed that this is equivalent to the homotopically equivalent path θ → k(θ). In our description of bundles over P(1, n), this path can be recovered from the transition functions µ, τ as lim r→0 {θ ∈ [0, 2π n ] → µ −1 (r, 0)µ(r, θ)}. The limit path may not exist, but this determines a homotopy class of paths from Id to τ (0) in K. (Recall µ −1 (r, 0)µ(r, 2π n ) = τ (r, 0) −1 .)

The next result follows easily from proposition 5.5.

Proposition 5.7. (Standard form near infinity for gauged holomorphic maps) Let P → P(1, n) be a principal K-bundle and let (A, u) be a gauged holomorphic map from P to X. There is a complex gauge transformation g on P and a trivialization of P over C so that g(A, u) satisfies the following:

(a) There is a λ ∈ k so that gA = d + λdθ on C\B R for some R > 0. The element λ satisfies e 2πnλ = Id. (b) For any θ ∈ [0, 2π), lim r→∞ e −λθ u(r, θ) = x and e 2πλ x = x.

Conversely, any gauged holomorphic map from C × K to X that satisfies the above conditions extends to a map on P(1, n) for some principal bundle P → P(1, n). n can be taken to be any positive integer so that e 2πnλ = Id.

Proof of proposition 5.1. By proposition 5.7, we can assume that for some R > 0, λ ∈ k, A = d + λdθ on C\B R , and lim r→∞ e −λθ u(r, θ) = x, and x ∈ X ss . Call the covering map π Σ :Σ → Σ. We denote π * Σ (A, u) also by (A, u). OnΣ, A = d + nλdθ Step 1: Let k 1 :Σ → K be the gauge transformation k 1 (r, θ) = e −nλθ . Then k 1 A = d onΣ and k 1 u extends holomorphically overΣ ∪ {∞} with u(∞) = x. We also observe that k 1 • σ n = e −2πλ k 1 .

Step 2: There is a holomorphic g 1 :Σ ∪ {∞} → G so that |Φ(g 1 k 1 u)| L 2 (Σ) < ∞. g 1 satisfies the symmetry relation g 1 (e 2πi/n ·) = γ −1 g 1 (·)e 2πλ , where γ ∈ K satisfies γ n = Id.

We remark that g 1 k 1 u extends holomorphically over ∞. We'll make |Φ(g 1 k 1 u)| L 2 (Σ) finite by choosing g 1 so that Φ(g 1 k 1 u(∞)) = 0 and
d(g 1 k 1 u)(∞) ⊆ T x Φ −1 (0) ∩ JT x Φ −1 (0).
Indeed, onΣ, Φ(g 1 k 1 u) and its derivative vanish at ∞, so |Φ(g 1 k 1 u)| L 2 (Σ) will be finite.

Pick s 0 ∈ k such that e is 0 x ∈ Φ −1 (0), denote y = e is 0 x. Apply the complex gauge transformation g ′ 1 ≡ e is 0 so that Φ • (g ′ 1 k 1 u) vanishes at ∞. Set γ = e is 0 e 2πλ e −is 0 . Next, we aim to find g ′′ 1 with g ′′ 1 (∞) = Id that makes the derivative of Φ•(g ′′ 1 g ′ 1 k 1 u) vanish at ∞. We need g ′′ 1 :Σ ∪ ∞ → G to satisfy g ′′ 1 • σ n = γ −1 g ′′ 1 γ. To satisfy both these conditions, we require that dg ′′ 1 (∞) : C → g be complex-linear and satisfy the following: (to simplify notation, denote
u 1 = g ′ 1 k 1 u) d(g ′′ 1 u 1 )(∞) ⊆ T y Φ −1 (0) ∩ JT y Φ −1 (0), dg ′′ 1 (∞)(dσ n (v)) = Ad −1 γ dg ′′ 1 (∞)(v)(11)
for all v ∈ T ∞ (Σ ∪ {∞}). The first condition translates to
dg ′′ 1 (∞)(v) y + du(v) ⊆ T y Φ −1 (0) ∩ JT y Φ −1 (0). The element dg ′′ 1 (∞)
is defined uniquely by this condition because g acts freely on T y X and T y X = gy ⊕ (T y Φ −1 (0) ∩ JT y Φ −1 (0)). Furthermore dg ′′ 1 (∞) is complexlinear and it satisfies the second condition in (11) because u 1 • σ n = γ −1 u. To produce g ′′ 1 given dg ′′ 1 , we use the following claim. Claim. Let Γ ⊂ G be a finite group and dim G = m. There is a linear Γ action on C m and a holomorphic Γ-equivariant chart φ : U → V ⊆ C m for a neighbourhood U ⊆ G containing Id. Also φ(Id) = 0. Γ acts on G by conjugation.

Proof of claim. Pick a holomorphic chart φ : U → C m with φ(Id) = 0. Equip C m with a Γ-action obtained by pushing forward the Γ-action via dφ(Id) : g → C m . Define, for y ∈ U ,
φ(y) := 1 |Γ| γ∈Γ γ −1 φ(γy).
φ is Γ-equivariant, and since dφ(0) = dφ(0), it is an isomorphism in a neighbourhood of 0.

We use the above claim taking Γ to be the cyclic group generated by γ. Given dg ′′ 1 (∞) and we have a Γ equivariant holomorphic chart φ : U → C m for a neighbourhood of Id ∈ G. Define φ • g ′′ 1 linearly by
φ • g ′′ 1 (z) := d(φ • g ′′ 1 )(∞) 1 z .
For a large enough R, g ′′ 1 is defined onΣ R ∪ {∞}. It is holomorphic and satisfies g ′′ 1 • σ n = γ −1 g ′′ 1 γ. Take g 1 := g ′′ 1 g ′ 1 .

Step 3: Finishing the proof Since g 1 found in Step 2 is holomorphic, it preserves the trivial connection k 1 A (see remark 2.5). So far, we have onΣ, g 1 k 1 (A, u) = (d, g 1 k 1 u). g 1 k 1 u extends holomorphically over ∞ and has the symmetry property g 1 k 1 u(e 2πi/n ·) = γg 1 k 1 u(·), where γ ∈ K satisfies γ n = Id.

We want to apply proposition 5.3 on Σ. But when we pass to Σ, we will no longer have Φ(u) in L 2 , because the metric on Σ is 'bigger' than that ofΣ. Our strategy is to apply a complex gauge transformation e iξ that makes Φ(u) vanish near infinity. We will show that ξ ∈ H 2 (Σ), so that the resulting connection is in H 1 (Σ) and its curvature is in L 2 (Σ). These conditions will be satisfied after passing to Σ (see (8)) so that proposition 5.3 can be applied. The details are as follows. The moment map Φ is real analytic so by step 2,
|Φ • u| = a 2 r 2 + a 3 r 3 + . . .
close to ∞ onΣ. Since G acts locally freely on the semistable locus, there is a unique ξ :Σ → k so that Φ(e iξ u) ≡ 0. The quotient X/ /G is compact, so |ξ| has similar asymptotic behavior as |Φ(u)| close to ∞, so ξ ∈ H 2 (Σ). By the symmetry of u, we can say that ξ satisfies ξ(e 2πi/n ·) = Ad −1 γ ξ(·). By lemma 5.4, e iξ g 1 k 1 (A) = d + a with a ∈ H 1 (Σ). By (8), if on Σ, e iξ g 1 k 1 (A) = d + a, then a H 1 (Σ) < ∞ and F d+a L 2 (Σ) < ∞. Note the symmetry relation e iξ g 1 k 1 (A, u)(e 2πi ·) = γ −1 e iξ g 1 k 1 (A, u)(·).

Now, e iξ g 1 k 1 (A, u) satisfies all the hypothesis of proposition 5.3, so there is a complex gauge transformation g 2 ∈ H 2 (Σ) that sends e iξ g 1 k 1 (A, u) to a finite energy symplectic vortex on Σ and satisfies g 2 (e 2πi ·) = γ −1 g 2 (·)γ.

Next, we construct a gauge transformation on C. We have the symmetry g 2 e iξ g 1 k 1 (e 2πi ·) = γ −1 g 2 e iξ g 1 k 1 (·).

Suppose ν ∈ k is such that e 2πν = γ, then re iθ → e νθ is a gauge transformation on Σ. e νθ g 2 e iξ g 1 k 1 is invariant under 2π rotations and so it descends to a complex gauge transformation g on Σ = C\B R . By remark 6.3, after modifying g by a gauge transformation, g(A, u) is smooth on C\B R . (Upstairs, this would amount to altering g 2 in a symmetric way.) Since both u and gu map to X ss on C\B R and G acts locally freely on X ss , g is also smooth on C\B R . To produce a smooth complex gauge transformation on all of C, we write g = ke iζ , where k ∈ K(Σ) and ζ : Σ → k are smooth. Let η be a cut-off function on C\B R that is 1 in C\B 2R and 0 in the neighbourhood of ∂B R . e iηζ ∈ G(C) makes (A, u) a finite energy vortex on C\B 2R . Finally, we look at the bundle P as a whole. Originally, P was described by transition functions µ = e −2πλ and τ = e nλθ . We applied the transformation g 2 e iξ g 1 onŨ 1 and the descent of e nνθ g 2 e iξ g 1 k 1 on U 2 . As a result of these transformations, P is now described by the transition functions µ = e −2πν and τ = e nνθ . The complex gauge transformation applied on P → P(1, n) is smooth on C. To look at its behaviour at ∞, we work on a neighbourhood inŨ 1 , where the complex gauge transformation is given by g 2 e iξ g 1 . g 1 and g 2 are smooth onŨ 1 . Since ξ ∈ H 2 (Σ), e iξ → Id as z → ∞. So, e iηζ is a smooth on C and extends continuously to a complex gauge transformation on P → P(1, n).


From a holomorphic map to a vortex : on the affine line

In this section we prove the first part of the main theorem 2.10. Given a gauged holomorphic map (A, u) on C that extends to a map over P(1, n), by proposition 5.1, there is a complex gauge transformation g on C so that g(A, u) is a vortex on C\B R 1 . Next, we need to find complex gauge transform g(A, u) so that it is a finite energy vortex on C. For this, we use theorem 4.1, which for Riemann surfaces Σ with boundary, provides a complex gauge transformation e iξ to change a gauged holomorphic map to a vortex. However, ξ is in H 2 δ , but the normal derivatives of ξ need not vanish on the boundary. This means, if we apply proposition 5.1 followed by theorem 4.1, the resulting connection A may not lie in W 1,p loc . So, the required result is obtained by applying theorem 4.1 to a sequence of compact sets that exhaust C.

To prove theorem 2.10 (i), we need the following lemma on convergence of vortices: [35]). Let p > 2 and Ω i be a sequence of precompact sets exhausting C:
Lemma 6.1 ([24],Ω 1 ⋐ Ω 2 ⋐ · · · ⋐ C i Ω i = C.
Suppose for each i,
(A i , u i ) ∈ H 2 × H 3 loc is a vortex on Ω i and sup i E(Ω i , (A i , u i )) < ∞.
Then, passing to a subsequence, there are gauge transformations k i ∈ H 3 (Ω i , K), a finite set Z ⊂ C and a finite energy vortex (A ∞ , u ∞ ) ∈ H 2 × H 3 loc over C such that (a) k i A i ⇀ A ∞ in H 2 on compact subsets of C, and strongly in W 1,p . (b) u i ⇀ u ∞ in H 3 on compact subsets of C\Z and strongly in W 2,p .

Proof. This lemma is a combination of results in [34] and [24]. But we explain how one can get the result for higher regularity spaces than that in [34]. By the bounded energy condition, we have, for some constant c,
d A i u i L 2 < c.
Since the image of all the u i is contained in a compact set ( [34]
), we get d A i Φ(u i ) L 2 is bounded. Hence, by the vortex condition * F A i + Φ(u i ) = 0, d A i * F A i L 2 is also bounded, that is, sup k≥i F A k H 1 (B i ) < ∞, ∀i > 0.
By Uhlenbeck compactness for non-compact manifolds (theorem A' in [31]), there is a sequence of gauge transformations
k i in H 3 so that k i A i ⇀ A ∞ in H 2 on compact subsets of C.
The rest of the proof is same as [24] -that there is a finite bubbling set Z, and away from this set, a subsequence of u i s converge in C 0 on compact subsets, and hence by elliptic regularity they converge weakly in H 3 . The elliptic regularity in this context is standard (theorem 3.1 in [7]), but we present a short self-contained proof in lemma 6.2. The strong convergence statements follow from the compact inclusion H k (Ω) ֒→ W 2,k−1 (Ω), where Ω ⊆ C is bounded. Lemma 6.2 (Elliptic regularity for gauged holomorphic maps). Let s ≥ 1, Ω ⊆ C be pre-compact and (A i , u i ) be a sequence of gauged holomorphic maps such that A i ⇀ A ∞ in H s (Ω) and u i → u ∞ in C 0 (Ω), then u i ⇀ u ∞ in H s+1 (Ω ′ ), for any Ω ′ , whose closure is contained in int(Ω).

Proof. The proof is by induction on s. The base case is proved in the same way as the induction step. First note that it suffices to work locally in X: Pick an atlas X = ∪ α V α such that V α is bi-holomorphic to an open subset of C n . Since u i → u ∞ in C 0 , we can find a finite cover Ω = ∪ β U β such that for u i (U β ) is contained in a single V β for large i. So, now we can think of u i as mapping to C n .

In each chart we apply a combination of Sobolev multiplication and regularity theorems. As in [7], write
A i = d + Φ i dx + Ψ i dy, where Ψ i , Φ i ∈ H s (Ω, k) and the holomorphicity equation for (A i , u i ) is −∂u i = Φ i (u i ) + J X Ψ i (u i )(12)
We know that both A i and u i weakly converge in H s , so Ψ i , Φ i and u i are uniformly bounded in H s . We next show that Φ i (u i ) and Ψ i (u i ) are uniformly bounded in H s . For this, recall L ∈ Γ(Ω, End(k, T Ω)) defined by (7). Φ i (u i ) can be seen as a product Φ i (u i ) = L(u i )Φ i . Since L is smooth, L(u i ) H s (Uα) < c for all i, α. By Sobolev multiplication (proposition A.5), for s ≥ 1,
L(u i )Φ i H s (Uα) ≤ c L(u i ) H s (Uα) Φ i H s (Uα) .
By holomorphicity, ∂u i H s (Uα) < c for all i, α. By elliptic regularity for curves in C n ,
u i H s+1 (U ′ α ) ≤ c( ∂u i H s (Uα) + u i L 2 (Uα) ). where U ′ α ⊆ U α and c depends on U α , U ′ α .
By picking U ′ α such that they cover Ω ′ , we obtain a uniform bound on u i H s+1 (Ω ′ ) and so u i ⇀ u ∞ in H s+1 (Ω ′ ). Remark 6.3 (Regularity for vortices). Proposition D.2 in [34] shows that given a vortex (A, u) ∈ W 1,p (C), p > 2, there is a gauge transformation k ∈ W 2,p (C, K) so that k(A, u) is smooth. Using the above lemma this can be strengthened to produce k ∈ H 2 for (A, u) ∈ H 1 × C 0 . The proof in [34] also applies for vortices on C\B Rit applies to any non-compact Riemann surface which can be exhausted by compact sets that are deformation retracts.

The following 2 results are also needed for the proof of theorem 2.10 (i). The first one is proposition 4.3.1 in [29]. Proposition 6.4. Let p > 2. Suppose Σ is a compact Riemann surface with boundary. Let (A i , u i ) ∈ H(P, X) be a sequence such that A i → A ∞ in W 1,p and there is a finite set Z ⊆ Σ so that u i → u ∞ in C 1 on compact subsets of Σ\(Z ∪ ∂Σ). Also,
F i := * F (A i ) + u * i Φ → 0 in L p .
Then, there exist constants C and i 0 so that for i > i 0 , there is a complex gauge transformation exp iξ i , ξ i ∈ W 2,p δ (Σ, P (g)) so that (exp iξ i )(A i , u i ) is a vortex and satisfies ξ i W 2,p < C F i L p .

The next one is proposition 4.3.2 in [29]. Roughly it says that in a complex gauge orbit, there is at most one vortex up to gauge. The proof is reproduced, because it will be useful in understanding the corresponding result for affine vortices. Proposition 6.5. Let (A 0 , u 0 ), (A 1 , u 1 ) ∈ H(P, X) be vortices on a compact Riemann surface Σ that are related by a complex gauge transformation g, i.e. (A 1 , u 1 ) = g(A 0 , u 0 ) and assume g(∂Σ) ⊆ K. Then, (A 0 , u 0 ) and (A 1 , u 1 ) are gauge-equivalent, i.e. g ∈ K.

Proof. After a gauge transformation, we can assume (A 1 , u 1 ) = e iξ (A 0 , u 0 ), where ξ ∈ Γ(Σ, P (k)) and ξ| ∂Σ = 0. Let (A t , u t ) := e itξ (A 0 , u 0 ). We know
F A 0 ,u 0 = F A 1 ,u 1 = 0. For ξ| ∂Σ = 0, d dt Σ * F At,ut , ξ = Σ d * At d At ξ + u * t dΦ(J(ξ) ut ), ξ k = d At ξ 2 L 2 + Σ ω ut ((ξ) ut , J(ξ) ut ) ≥ 0.
The inequality is strict for non-zero ξ. So, ξ = 0 and (A 0 , u 0 ) and (A 1 , u 1 ) are gauge-equivalent.

Proof of theorem 2.10 (i). Given a gauged holomorphic map (A, u) on P → P(1, n), proposition 5.1 produces a complex gauge transformation e is on P (that is smooth on C and continuous at ∞). (A 0 , u 0 ) := e is (A, u)| C is a finite energy vortex on C\B R . Next applying theorem 4.1, for any i > R, there is a complex gauge transformation
g i ∈ W 2,p δ (B i , G) such that (A i , u i ) := g i (A 0 , u 0 ) is a vortex on B i .
By modifying the g i s by gauge transformations, if necessary, we may assume that (A i , u i ) is smooth (by theorem 3.1 in [7]). Also, recall that
E(A i , u i , B i ) ≤ E(A 0 , u 0 , B i ).
Since {(A i , u i )} are a sequence of vortices on B i , which exhaust C and they satisfy an energy bound, they converge modulo bubbling to a finite energy vortex (A ∞ , u ∞ ) on C. i.e. By lemma 6.1, there is a subsequence of (A i , u i ) (still denoted by the same subscripts), a sequence of gauge transformations k i ∈ H 3 (B i ) and a finite set Z ⊆ C so that k i (A i , u i ) converges to (A ∞ , u ∞ ) in W 1,p × W 2,p (K) for all compact sets K ⊆ C\Z. For ease of notation we absorb the gauge transformations k i into g i and assume that (A i , u i ) converges to (A ∞ , u ∞ ) away from the bubbling set Z. Since (A ∞ , u ∞ ) has finite energy, Φ(u ∞ (z)) → 0 as z → ∞. So, we may assume, by increasing R if necessary, that u ∞ (C\B R ) ⊆ X ss . Also, we can assume Z ⊆ B R and so for large i, u i (C\B R ) ⊆ X ss . In the next 3 paragraphs, we show that there is no bubbling. For this we focus our attention on B 2R .

Since there is no bubbling on B 2R \B R and since
u i (B 2R \B R ) ⊆ X ss for all i including i = ∞, there is a sequence of complex gauge transformations g ′ i ∈ W 2,p (B 2R \B R ) such that g ′ i (A i , u i ) = (A ∞ , u ∞ ) on B 2R \B R .
We remark that such g ′ i exist because the action of G on X ss is locally free, but the choice of g ′ i may not be unique .
Write g ′ i = k ′ i e iξ ′ i , where k ′ i : B 2R \B R → K and ξ ′ i : B 2R → k.
We know u i → u ∞ in W 2,p (B 2R \B R ). By applying lemma 6.6 and corollary 6.7, there is a subsequence of g ′ i that converges to Id in W 2,p (B 2R \B R ) , and since (2) is a smooth function,
ξ ′ i → 0 in W 2,p (B 2R \B R )
. Consider a cut-off function η : B 2R \B R → [0, 1] that is 1 in the neighbourhood of ∂B 2R and 0 in the neighbourhood of ∂B R . Then, k ′ i e iηξ ′ i (A i , u i ) is a gauged holomorphic map on B 2R that agrees with (A ∞ , u ∞ ) close to the boundary. It satisfies F
k ′ i e iηξ ′ i (A i ,u i ) → 0 in L p (B 2R ), because F k ′ i e iηξ ′ i (A i ,u i ) is non-zero only in B 2R \B R . So, we also have F e iηξ ′ i (A i ,u i ) → 0 in L p (B 2R ). By proposition 6.4, for large i, there exist ξ ′′ i ∈ W 2,p (B 2R , k), such that e iξ ′′ i e iηξ ′ i (A i , u i ) is a vortex. Proposition 6.4 also shows that ξ ′′ i → 0 in W 2,p (B 2R ). We are now ready to show that Z = ∅. Since ξ ′ i , ξ ′′ i → 0 in W 2,p (B 2R ) and A i → A ∞ in W 1,p (B 2R ), we get e iξ ′′ i e iηξ ′ i A i → A ∞ in W 1,p (B 2R )
. By proposition 6.5, for all i, e iξ ′′ i e iξ ′ i (A i , u i ) are in the same gauge orbit as each other. By standard elliptic regularity arguments (see [29,Lemma 4.3.4]) A ∞ is also in the same gauge orbit and if k ′′
i e iξ ′′ i e iηξ ′ i A i = A ∞ for k ′′ i ∈ W 2,p (B 2R ), then k i ⇀ Id in W 2,p (B 2R ). k i → Id strongly in C 1 (B 2R ). So, g i → g ∞ in C 1 (B 2R ), therefore u i = g i u 0 → g ∞ u 0 in C 1 (B 2R ). Since g ∞ u 0 = u ∞ , we have Z = ∅.
Since the action of G on X ss is locally free, for z ∈ C\B R we may define g >R (z) to be an element such that g ∞ (z)u 0 (z) = u ∞ (z), unique up to right multiplication by an element of the finite stabilizer G u 0 (z) . Given a choice of such g >R (z ′ ) for some z ′ ∈ C\B R , this choice uniquely extends to g >R (z) for all z ∈ C\B R . Since g ∞ (z)u 0 (z)u ∞ (z) for z ∈ B 2R , this implies that g ∞ extends uniquely to a complex gauge transformation on all of C satisfying g ∞ u 0 = u ∞ . In addition g ∞ A 0 = A ∞ . The reason for this is as follows: for x ∈ X ss close to Φ −1 (0), we have
k x ∩ Jk x = φ.(13)
Since u ∞ (∞) ∈ Φ −1 (0), by increasing R, if necessary, we can assume that this condition is satisfied for all u ∞ (c) for c ∈ C\B R . Let g ∞ A 0 − A ∞ = a. Since both (gA 0 , u ∞ ) and (A ∞ , u ∞ ) are holomorphic, we have a 0,1 u∞ = 0. Write a = a x dx + a y dy, a x , a y : C\B R → k. Then, a x (u) + Ja y (u) = 0 and by (13), a = 0 on C\B R .

We look at the regularity of g ∞ . Using proposition D.2 in [34], we can modify g ∞ by a gauge transformation in W 2,p loc , so that g ∞ (A 0 , u 0 ) is smooth. By applying lemma 6.8 in neighbourhoods in C, we conclude that g ∞ : C → G is smooth. Write g ∞ = k ∞ e iξ∞ . We assumed (A 0 , u 0 ) to be a finite energy vortex on C\B R , which means lim r→∞ u 0 (r, θ) ∈ Φ −1 (0) for any θ. The same is true for u ∞ also. This implies that ξ ∞ (r, θ) → 0 as r → ∞.

We now have a complex gauge transformation e iξ∞ e is on P that is smooth on C and continuous at ∞, we show that e iξ∞ e is ∈ G(P ) we . Given the finite energy vortex e iξ∞ e is (A, u), theorem 2.10(ii) gives g ∈ G(P ′ ) we so that ge iξ∞ (A, u) is a smooth gauged holomorphic map on P ′ → P(1, n). (The proof of part (ii) of the theorem is independent of part (i)). By using the arguments in the uniquess part of the proof of theorem 2.10(ii), P ′ and P are isomorphic, so we assume P ′ = P . The proof of uniqueness in (ii) still applies if we weaken the assumption g 1 , g 2 ∈ G(P ) we , and instead just assume that g 1 , g 2 are smooth on C and extend continuously over ∞. So, ge iξ∞ e is ∈ G(P ) is smooth. Since g ∈ G(P ) we , the same is true for e iξ∞ e is also. That the vortex e iξ∞ e is (A, u) is unique up to gauge transformations, is proved separately in proposition 7.4 using theorem 2.10 (ii). Lemma 6.6, corollary 6.7 and lemma 6.8 were used in the proof of theorem 2.10 (i). Lemma 6.6. Suppose Ω ⊆ C is compact and that the maps u i : Ω → X ss converge in W 2,p to u ∞ : Ω → X ss . Also, we are given g i : Ω → G so that g i u i = u ∞ . Then, a subsequence of g i converges in W 2,p to g ∞ .

Proof. Let x ∈ X/ /G and y ∈ π −1 G (x). We can find a slice at y, i.e. a locally closed G y -invariant submanifold V ⊂ X ss containing y and so that there is an isomorphism 
V × Gy G → GV . So, V × G → GV is a |G y |-cover. Suppose U ⊂ Ω is such that u ∞ (U ) ⊂ V , u i (U ) ⊂ V for large i.(v ∞ , G ∞ ) : U → V × G. Choose the lifts u i = (v i , G i ) so that G −1 ∞ G i = g i .
Since u i → u ∞ , a subsequence ofũ i converges in W 2,p . (This is because: G × V → GV is a local diffeomorphism and has inverses locally. ∪ i u i (U ) ⊂ V is pre-compact, and in this set the derivatives of the inverse of G × V → GV are bounded.) So, G i converges and consequently g i → g ∞ . Working with the chosen cover of Ω, by successively passing to subsequences, we obtain a limit g ∞ on all of Ω. Corollary 6.7. In the above lemma, g ∞ stabilizes u ∞ . So by replacing g i by g −1 ∞ g i , we can obtain a sequence of complex gauge transformations that converge to Id in W 2,p . Lemma 6.8. (Regularity of complex gauge transformations) Let Ω be a compact Riemann surface and P → Ω be a principal K-bundle, and P C := P × K G a Gbundle. Suppose A ∈ A(P ) is a smooth connection and g ∈ G(P ) 2,p a complex transformation such that gA is also smooth. Then g is smooth.

Proof. We use the relation on P C :
∂ gA = g • ∂ A • g −1 . a := gA − A is smooth and ∂ gA − ∂ A = a 0,1 = g∂ A (g −1 ) = −∂ A gg −1 .
Therefore a 0,1 g = −∂ A g. The smoothness of g follows by elliptic bootstrapping.


From vortices to holomorphic maps

In this section, we prove theorem 2.10 (ii). The main tool used is the following result on the asymptotic behavior of a finite energy vortex (A, u) on C.

Proposition 7.1. (Exponential Decay for Vortices) Suppose G acts locally freely on X ss . Let n be a positive integer such that for any x ∈ X ss , the order of the stabilizer group |G x | divides n. Let (A, u) be a finite energy vortex on C with target X. Then, for every ǫ > 0, there is a constant C such that |F A (z)| 2 + |d A u(z)| 2 + |Φ(u(z))| 2 ≤ C|z| −2− 2 n +ǫ , ∀z ∈ C\B 1 . The norms are taken with respect to the standard Euclidean metric on C.

Ziltener [36] proves this result for n = 1, in appendix B, we explain how it generalizes to the case when X/ /G is an orbifold. The following are conclusions of proposition 7.1. (proofs in appendix B). d(x 0 , k 0 (θ)u(re iθ )) = 0.

Suppose, the restriction of A in radial gauge to the circle {|z| = r} ≃ S 1 is d + adθ, for any 0 < γ < 1 n , there is a c such that for r ≥ 1, |k −1 0 ∂ θ k 0 + a(r, ·)| < cr −γ . Necessarily, x 0 is fixed by k 0 (2π), which is of finite order.

Proof of theorem 2.10 (ii). Recall the notation Σ R = C\B R andΣ R = C\B R 1/n is its n-cover with covering map z → z n . The value of R will be fixed in the course of the proof.

First, we show that, after a gauge transformation, (Ã,ũ) := (A, u)(z −n ), defined over C\{0}, extends in a weak sense to all of C. Note that we are working on the chartŨ 1 ≃ C from 2.6. To (Ã,ũ), apply the gauge transformationk(r, θ) := k 0 (nθ) where k 0 is given by Proposition 7.2. Recall that k 0 was only defined on [0, 2π], which can be extended as k 0 (θ + 2π) = k 0 (2π)k 0 (θ). This way,k is a well-defined gauge transformation on C\{0}. By proposition 7.1,kũ extends continuously over ∞, withkũ(∞) = x 0 . This makesũ lie in W 1,p loc (Ũ 1 ). We claim thatkÃ also extends to an L p connection overΣ R ∪ {∞}. For this, we assumeÃ is in radial gauge, sõ A = d + adθ. Then,
kÃ p L p (B 1 ) ≈ 1 0 2π 0 | 1 r (k −1 0 ∂ θ k 0 + a(r −n , θ))| p rdθdr ≤ c 1 0 r nγp+1−p dr,
which is finite by choosing γ > 1 n (1 − 2 p ). Next, we show that for some smallR,kÃ can be complex gauge-transformed to the trivial connection on BR ⊂Ũ 1 . For 0 <R < 1, let σR :
B 1 → BR denote the dilation function x →Rx. LettingkÃ = d +ã, we have σ * R (kÃ) = d + Rã(R·). Now σ * R (kÃ) L p (B 1 ) = Rã (R·) L p (B 1 ) =R 1− 2 p ã L p (BR) .
For someR ∈ (0, 1], σ * RÃ L p (B 1 ) is small enough that lemma 7.3 is applicable, which means that there isξ ∈ W 1,p 0 (BR) andk 1 ∈ W 1,p (BR, K) so that F e iξkÃ = 0 andk 1 e iξkÃ = d. Pickk 1 so thatk 1 (0) = Id. We observe that σ * n (kA) = k 0 (2π)A. By symmetry arguments similar to the proof of proposition 5.5, we see thatξ • σ n = Ad k 0 (2π)ξ andk 1 • σ n = k 0 (2π)k 1 k 0 (2π) −1 . Putting everything together, we have σ * n (k 1 e iξk ) = k 0 (2π)k 1 e iξk .

We find a complex gauge transformation g over C (U 2 in the notation of 2.6) corresponding tok 1 e iξk on BR\{0} and show that g(A, u) extends to a smooth gauged holomorphic map on a bundle P → P(1, n). Let R =R −1/n . Suppose k 0 : [0, 2π] → K is homotopic to the geodesic θ → e −λθ with k 0 (2π) = e −2πλ . e nλθk 1 e iξk descends to a complex gauge transformation g on C\B R -it satisfies e nλθk 1 e iξk (z) = g( 1 z n ). The map g : C\B R → G is homotopic to identity. This is because: on BR\{0} ⊂Ũ 1 , bothk −1k 1 e iξk and e nλθk are homotopic to identity. Let g t : C\B R → G be a deformation of g to Id, i.e. g 0 ≡ Id and g 1 = g. Let η be a cut-off function on C\B R that vanishes in the neighbourhood of ∂B R and is 1 in the neighbourhood of ∂B 2R , then g η (A, u) satisfies the conditions in proposition 5.7i.e. on C\B 2R , g η A = d + λdθ and lim r→∞ e −λθ g η u(r, θ) = x 0 . So, g η (A, u) extends to a gauged holomorphic curve over P(1, n). g : C\B R → G is smooth because both u and gu are smooth and u(C\B R ) ⊂ X ss , where G acts locally freely. So, g η is smooth on C. It follows from the construction ofk 1 e iξk that, g η (A, u) extends to a smooth gauged holomorphic map over P → P(1, n) described by transition functions µ = e −2πλ and τ = e nλθ . This indeed proves the statement of the theorem. g η can be written as g η = e iζ k, where k ∈ K(C) and ζ : C → k are smooth. We claim that e −iζ ∈ G(P ) we , so that we can say that k(A, u) extends to a weak gauged holomorphic map over P → P(1, n). Letζ :Ũ 1 → k be defined asζ(z) = ζ( 1 z n ). The complex gauge transformation e −iζ on U 2 corresponds to e −nλθ e −iζ e nλθ on BR /2 n ⊂Ũ 1 . By straightforward calulations, this is equal tok 1 e −iξk−1 1 , which is in W 1,p (BR /2 n ). Since k(A, u) extends to a weak gauged holomorphic map over P , the same can be said about (A, u), since k just contributes to the choice of trivialization of P | C .

Uniqueness: Given a finite energy vortex (A, u), the bundle P → P(1, n) is determined uniquely by the path {θ ∈ [0, 2π n ] → k 0 (θ)} up to homotopy and the action of Ad k for k ∈ K (see remark 5.6). k 0 is determined using proposition 7.1, the choice of this equivalence class is unique because it has to satisfy the condition
lim r→∞ max θ∈[0,2π] d(x 0 , k 0 (θ)u(re iθ )) = 0, where x 0 = lim r→∞ u(r, 0) ∈ Φ −1 (0).
Now suppose g 1 , g 2 ∈ G(P ) we so that g i (A, u) is a smooth gauged holomorphic map on P . On BR ⊂Ũ 1 , g 1 u, g 2 u are smooth maps to X ss , where G acts locally freely. So, g −1 1 g 2 is smooth in this region and hence g −1 1 g 2 ∈ G(P ).

The following lemma is used in the proof of theorem 2.10 (ii).

Lemma 7.3. Let A = d + a be a connection on the trivial K-bundle over B 1 ⊆ C so that a ∈ L p (B 1 ). There is a constant c 1 such that if a L p (B 1 ) < c 1 , there is ξ ∈ W 1,p 0 (B 1 , k) satisfying F e iξ A = 0. Further, there is a gauge transformation k ∈ W 1,p (B 1 , K) so that ke iξ A = d. k is unique up to left multiplication by a constant element in K.

Proof. The proof is by implicit function theorem on the function
F : W 1,p 0 (B 1 , k) → W −1,p (B 1 , k), ξ → * F e iξ A . The linearization at ξ DF(ξ) = d * e iξ A d e iξ A : W 1,p 0 (B 1 , k) → W −1,p (B 1 , k).(14)
We recall that W −1,p = (W 1,p * 0 ) * , where W 1,p * 0 is the subspace of W 1,p * sections whose boundary trace vanishes, 1 p + 1 p * = 1 and the dual is taken under the L 2 pairing. The operator d * d : k) is an isomorphism (see theorem 4.7 in [31]). If A = d + a and a ∈ L p , then
W 1,p 0 (B 1 , k) → W −1,p (B 1 ,(d * A d A − d * d)ξ = * [a ∧ * dξ] + d * [a ∧ ξ] + * [a ∧ * [a ∧ ξ]].(15)
By the multiplication theorem (proposition A.5), this is compact. In W 1,p , ker d * A d A consists of horizontal sections with respect to A, so W 1,p 0 ∩ ker d * (14) is an isomorphism. By (15)
A d A = {0}, so, d * A d A − d * d ≤ c a L p . If a L p is small enough, (d * A d A ) −1 ≤ 2 (d * d) −1 .
In the statement of the implicit function theorem (proposition A.4), we take C := 2 (d * d) −1 .


Similar to

Step 2 in the proof of proposition 5.3, we can obtain a constant δ > 0 such that for ξ 1,p < δ,
DF ξ − DF 0 ≤ 1 2C .
By proposition A.4, if F A −1,p < δ 4C , we get the result. This can be ensured if a L p is small enough because by the multiplication theorem,
F A −1,p ≤ c( a L p + a 2 L p ).
We next prove the second statement of the lemma. First note that a flat connection is gauge-equivalent to a connection that is smooth away from the boundary ∂B 1 . Indeed, this is proved in [30] (theorem 3.1) for a base manifold without boundary, but since we only want interior regularity, the proof is identical. We briefly outline this proof: For a smooth connection A, if we pick a smooth connection A 0 close enough to A (in the L p norm), there is a gauge transformation k ∈ W 1,p that puts A in coulomb gauge with respect to A 0 , that is,
d * A 0 (kA − A 0 ) = 0.
This is the content of the local slice theorem (theorem F') in [31]. Now, one has control over da and d * a, using elliptic bootstrapping as in [30], it can be shown that kA is smooth away from ∂B R . Similar to the first statement in the lemma, here we rely on the ellipticity of ∆ : W 1,p 0 → W −1,p . Finally note that a smooth flat connection on a contractible set is gauge equivalent to the trivial connection. The uniqueness statement in the lemma is obvious because the trivial connection is preserved only by constant gauge transformations.

The following is the last component in the proof of the main theorem 2.10. To state it, we assume the result of part (ii) of this theorem. Proposition 7.4. (At most one vortex in a complex gauge orbit) Suppose (A 0 , u 0 ) and (A 1 , u 1 ) are finite energy vortices on C that extend to a weak gauged holomorphic map over a bundle P → P(1, n). Suppose they are related by a complex gauge transformation g ∈ G(P ) we . Then g is a unitary gauge transformation, i.e. g ∈ K(P ) we .

Proof. g can be written as g = ke iξ , where k ∈ K(P ) we and ξ ∈ Γ(P(1, n), P (k)) we . We can assume k = Id and (A 1 , u 1 ) = e iξ (A 0 , u 0 ). The proof proceeds in the same way as the corresponding result for vortices on a compact Riemann surface (proposition 6.5). Let (A t , u t ) := e itξ (A, u) for t ∈ [0, 1]. We write
d dt C * F At,ut , ξ = C d * At d At ξ + u * t dΦ(J(ξ) ut ), ξ k = d At ξ 2 L 2 + C ω ut ((ξ) ut , J(ξ) ut ) + lim r→∞ ∂Br d At ξ, ξ k .(16)
However, for the above computation to make sense, we need to show that the terms d At ξ L 2 (C) and C ω ut ((ξ) ut , J(ξ) ut ) are finite and the boundary term vanishes.

Step 1: d At ξ L 2 < ∞ for t ∈ [0, 1]. We work on the chart containing infinity -this isŨ 1 from 2.6. Consider BR ⊂Ũ 1 , for someR > 0. We have A 0 ∈ L p (BR) and ξ ∈ W 1,p (BR). Repeating the calculations in lemma 5.4 for different Sobolev spaces, we can say A t − A 0 ∈ L p (BR). Since p > 2, d At ξ L 2 (BR) is finite. Let R = (R) −1/n . The norms d At ξ L 2 (C\B R ) and d At ξ L 2 (BR) are equal, so both are finite, and hence d At ξ L 2 < ∞ for 0 ≤ t ≤ 1.

Step 2: C ω ut ((ξ) ut , J(ξ) ut ) < ∞ for t ∈ [0, 1]. We use asymptotic decay of vortices (proposition 7.1) to obtain an asymptotic bound on |ξ|: fix an 0 < ǫ < 2 n , let δ = 2 n −ǫ, then there is a constant c so that for z ∈ C\B 1 ,
e A,u (z) ≤ c|z| −2−δ .
Since X/ /G is compact, there are constants c, ǫ so that for any x ∈ {|Φ| < ǫ},
c −1 s 1 , s 2 k ≤ (s 1 ) x , (s 2 ) x TxX ≤ c s 1 , s 2 k(17)
for s 1 , s 2 ∈ k. As a consequence, there is a constant c such that for any x ∈ Φ −1 (0) and s ∈ k such that e is x ∈ {|Φ| < ǫ},
c −1 |s| < |Φ(e is x)| < c|s|.
We assume R is large enough that u 0 (C\B R ), u 1 (C\B R ) ⊂ {|Φ| < ǫ}. Using asymptotic decay of Φ(u 0 ) L 2 and Φ(u 1 ) L 2 , we conclude
|ξ(z)| 2 < c|z| −2−δ .(18)
Since u t (C\B R ) ⊂ {|Φ| < ǫ} for t = 0, 1, by (17) and some straightforward calculations, we can conclude the same for all t ∈ [0, 1]. The bound |ξ(z)| < c|z| −2−δ , together with (17), shows |ω ut ((ξ) ut , J(ξ) ut )(z)| < c|z| −2−δ . Hence C ω ut ((ξ) ut , J(ξ) ut ) < ∞, 0 ≤ t ≤ 1.

Step 3: lim r→∞ ∂Br d At ξ, ξ k for t ∈ [0, 1]. In step 1, we showed that A t is in L 2 (C\B R ), but this isn't enough to say anything about A t | ∂Br . We now obtain a C 0 -bound under suitable local trivializations of P . For this we cover C\B R by identical open sets : let S ⊆ C be an open set with smooth boundary such that
[− 3 4 , 3 4 ] × [− 3 4 , 3 4 ] ⊆ S ⊆ [−1, 1] × [−1, 1].
Then, {S + (x, y) : |x|, |y| ≥ R − 2} is a cover of C\B R . Let S ′′ ⋐ S ′ ⋐ S be such that their translates also cover C\B R . The quantity d At ξ, ξ k is gauge-invariant, so on each S + (x, y), we can choose a different trivialization to study it. We focus on a single set S xy := S + (x, y) and let r := x 2 + y 2 . In the following discussion, the constant c is independent of (x, y) and r. Fix a trivialization of P | Sxy so that A 0 = d + a 0 is in Uhlenbeck gauge i.e.
a 0 W 1,p (Sxy) < c F (A 0 ) L p (Sxy) < c.(19)
Under this trivialization, we write A t = d + a t . By applying a gauge transformation k : S xy → K, we can put A 1 in Uhlenbeck gauge -i.e. if kA 1 = d +ã 1 then,
ã 1 W 1,p (Sxy) < c F (A 1 ) L p (Sxy) < c.(20)
Denote g = ke iξ , so gA 0 = d +ã 1 . As in the proof of lemma 6.8, we can write a 0,1 g = −∂ A 0 g, where a =ã 1 − a 0 . By elliptic regularity, g W 1,p (S ′ xy ) ≤ c( ∂g L p (Sxy) + g L p (Sxy) ) ≤ c( a 0,1 g L p (Sxy) + a 0,1 0 g L p (Sxy) ) + c g L ∞ (Sxy) )

There is a L ∞ bound on g from (18) and the fact that K is compact. Together with the bounds on a and a 0 (from (19) and (20)), this shows that g W 1,p (S ′ xy ) ≤ c. By applying elliptic regularity again, we can show g W 2,p (S ′′ xy ) ≤ c. Since (2) is an isomorphism,
ξ W 2,p (S ′′ xy ) ≤ c.(21)
Repeating the calculations in lemma 5.4 for different Sobolev spaces, we get a t − a 0 W 1,p (S ′′ xy ) < c. Together with the bound on a 0 , this uniformly bounds a t W 1,p (Sxy) . By Sobolev embedding a t C 0 (Sxy) < c for 0 ≤ t ≤ 1.

Consider the integral ∂Br d At ξ, ξ k . Partition the curve ∂B r at points x 1 , . . . , x n , so that the segments x i x (i+1) mod n are in a single S ′′ xy , ∂Br d At ξ, ξ k = n i=1

x i+1

x i dξ, ξ k +

x i+1

x i [a t , ξ], ξ k

The first term evaluates to i ξ(x i+1 ), ξ(x i+1 ) k − ξ(x i ), ξ(x i ) k . By a change of trivialization ξ(x i ), ξ(x i ) k is not altered because ·, · k is Ad K -invariant. So, the first terms for all i sum to zero. The second term goes to zero as r → ∞ because of the C 0 bound on a t and the asymptotic bound on ξ (18).

Step 4: Finishing the proof.

We have shown that the equation (16) is meaningful and the boundary term vanishes as r → ∞. So, d dt C * F At,ut , ξ > 0 if ξ = 0. Since F A 0 ,u 0 = F A 1 ,u 1 = 0, this implies that ξ = 0.


Appendix A. Some analytic results

In this section, we collect some analytic results used in the proof. The first is a modification of a theorem of Calderón (see theorem V.3 p.135 in [26]) which says that Id +∆ : W 2,p (C, C) → L p (C, C) is an isomorphism for p > 1. (Id +∆)f, g L 2 = f, g L 2 + df, dg L 2 = f, g H 1 So, (Id +∆) : H 1 0 → (H 1 0 ) * is given by f → f, · H 1 0 . By the Riesz representation theorem, this is an isomorphism.

Let f ∈ L 2 (Σ) ֒→ H −1 . Then, there is a g ∈ H 1 0 so that (Id +∆)g = f . By elliptic regularity on bounded sets, g ∈ H 2 loc (Σ). It remains to bound g in H 2 (Σ). For this, we apply elliptic regularity on a collection of bounded sets that cover Σ. Let Ω ′ := B 3−ǫ \B 1 . Let S ′ ⊂ S be such that {S ′ + (x, y) : |x|, |y| ≥ 2, x, y ∈ Z} ∪ {Ω ′ } is also a cover of Σ ′ . There is a constant c S,S ′ depending only on S, S ′ so that for any integers |x|, |y| ≥ 2, g H 2 (S ′ +(x,y)) ≤ c S,S ′ ( f L 2 (S+(x,y)) + g H 1 (S+(x,y)) ), (22) Since g| ∂B 1 = 0,
g H 2 (Ω ′ ) ≤ c Ω,Ω ′ ( f L 2 (Ω) + g H 1 (Ω) ),(23)
Adding (23) and (22) for all x, y ∈ Z, we get
g H 2 (Σ) ≤ c( f L 2 (Σ) + g H 1 (Σ) ) ≤ c ′ f L 2 (Σ) ,
where c, c ′ are independent of f . Remark A.3. The above theorem still holds if Σ = C\B 1 is replaced by an isometric n-cover Σ = {re iθ : r ≥ 1, θ ∈ R/2nπZ}. This is because the covering by S + (x, y) can be lifted to Σ. Then, all but a bounded part of Σ, can be covered by identicallooking sets.

The other results presented here are very standard. The following is proposition A.3.4 in [20].

Since E((A, u), Σ) is finite, the right side goes to 0 as s → ∞. So, for large enough s 0 , Φ(u(s, t)) is close enough to 0 and so u(s, t) ∈ X ss , and u G := π G • u is well-defined and is a holomorphic curve on X/ /G. Also, ℓ(u G ({s = s 1 , t ∈ R/aZ})) ≤ 

Now, we switch to working on X/ /G to prove the result. For every p ∈ X/ /G, there is a neighbourhood U p and a uniformizing chart (V p , G p , π) such that V p ⊂ C m , G p is a finite group acting on U p and π : U p → V p induces a homeomorphism from U p /G p to V p (see [6]). Each U p has a G p -invariant symplectic form that descends to the symplectic form on X/ /G. X/ /G is compact, so it can be covered by a finite number of such neighbourhoods U 1 , . . . , U k . Fix a constant δ 0 > 0 such that for any p ∈ X/ /G, B p (δ) ⊂ U i for some i ∈ {1, . . . , k}. If the length of the loop γ : S 1 → X/ /G is less than δ 0 , it can be lifted to the cover in some uniformizing chart and the isoperimetric inequality (Theorem 4.4.1, [20]) can be applied. The rest of the proof can be completed in the same way as the proof of the removal of singularities result for J-holomorphic curves in [20] (theorem 4.1.2). We need the second paragraph of the proof of lemma 4.5.1 (this requires Stokes' theorem for orbifolds, which can be proved by passing to a cover locally using regularizing charts), followed by the proof of theorem 4.1.2. Note that we we don't require holomorphic extension of u G over the singularity. Proposition 7.1 now follows in a straightforward way.

Proof of proposition 7.1. Map C\B 1 to the half cylinder Σ setting a = 2π and the change of coordinates Σ ∋ z → e z ∈ C\B 1 . By proposition B.3, u G (∞) := lim s→∞ u G (s, t) exists. Pick x ∈ π −1 G (u G (∞)), and let S be a slice for the G-action at x. This means G× Gx S → X ss is a diffeomorphism onto its image. π : G×S → X ss is a |G x |-cover, equip G × S with π * ω X and π * ω X . The left K-action is free and has moment map π * Φ. n divides G x , so for some large s 0 , u(Σ s>s 0 ) ⊆ GS and it lifts to u : Σ s>s 0 → G × S. Here Σ s>s 0 = {(s, t) : s ≥ s 0 , t ∈ R/2πnZ} is an n-cover of Σ s>s 0 . Now, proposition B.2 can be applied to the lift (A, u) : Σ s≥s 0 → G × S, and this proves proposition 7.1.

Proof of proposition 7.2. We work in cylindrical co-ordinates. Map C\B 1 to the half cylinder Σ = {(s, t) : s ≥ 0, t ∈ [0, 2π)}, with change of coordinates Σ ∋ z → e z ∈ C\B 1 . The Euclidean metric on C\B 1 pulls back to ω Σ = e 2s dsdt on Σ. The connection A can be put in radial gauge, so that on Σ, A = d + a(s, t)dt. If F A = f ds ∧ dt, then ∂ ∂s a = f . By proposition 7.1, for any ǫ > 0, there is a C so that | ∂ ∂s a| = |f | ≤ Ce (− 1 n + ǫ 2 )s .

Fix an ǫ < 2 n . There exists a ∞ ∈ C 0 (R/2πZ, k) so that |a(s, t) − a ∞ (t)| ≤ c ǫ e (− 1 n + ǫ 2 )s for all s, t. The bound on d A u coming from proposition 7.1 can be written as
| ∂ ∂s u| + | ∂ ∂t u + a u | ≤ Ce (−2− 1 n + ǫ 2 )s .
The bound on | ∂ ∂s u| implies that lim s→∞ u(s, t) = u ∞ (t), where u ∞ ∈ C 0 (S 1 , X). Since π G •u has a limit at ∞, u ∞ maps to a single G-orbit. The decay of Φ(u) implies that u ∞ maps to Φ −1 (0), and hence to a single K-orbit. Let k 0 : [0, 2π] → K be such that k 0 (t)u ∞ (0) = u ∞ (t). Observe that k 0 (2π) stabilizes u ∞ (0). Finally, the bound on | ∂ ∂t u + a u | implies that a ∞ = −k −1 0 ∂ θ k 0 . This also means that k 0 ∈ C 1 (S 1 , k).

Remark 2 . 5 .
25On the bundle Σ × K, the stabilizer of the trivial connection A = d is the subgroup of holomorphic gauge transformation g : Σ → G, since such gauge transformations commute with ∂ A .

Then, there is a complex gauge transformation g = e iξ , ξ ∈ W 2,p δ (for any p > 2) such that g(A, u) is a vortex. Up to unitary gauge equivalence, g(A, u) is the unique vortex in the complex gauge orbit of (A, u).

1Let Σ = C\B 1 . The operator Id +∆ : H 2 δ (Σ) → L 2 (Σ) is an isomorphism. Remark A.2. H 2 δ = {f ∈ H 2 : f | ∂Σ = 0}. To keep track of signs, we recall ∆ = −( ∂ 2 ∂x 2 + ∂ 2 ∂y 2 ) = d * dWe give a proof of this variation so that it is easy to see how it applies to an n-cover of Σ as well.(see remark A.3) Proof of proposition A.1. First, we show that Id +∆ : H 1 0 → H −1 is an isomorphism. Recall that H −1 = (H 1 0 ) * via the L 2 -pairing. For any f , g ∈ H 1 0

Let Ω ⊆ R n , not necessarily compact. The multiplication operatorIf Ω is compact, s 1 + s 2 > 0 and s 3 < max(s 1 , s 2 ), the operator is compact. Definition B.1 (Energy density). Suppose (A, u) is a vortex from the principal bundle P → Σ to X. The energy density of (A, u) isfor any z ∈ Σ. The norms are defined in terms of the metric ω Σ on Σ.Proposition B.2 (Decay for vortices on the half cylinder,[36], theorem 1.3). Let Σ be a half cylinder Σ := {(s, t) : s ≥ 0, t ∈ R/aZ} for some a > 0 with an admissible metric ω Σ = λ 2 ds ∧ dt where λ = λ(s, t) is a positive function.

Proposition B.3.Suppose (A, u)is a finite energy vortex on the half cylinder Σ (described in proposition B.2). Let π G : X ss → X/ /G denote the projection. Then, lim s→∞ π G • u exists.Proof. The proof of proposition B.3 uses a combination of results from[36]and[20]. The main difficulty is that the action of G on X ss is not free.[36]considers vortices where this action is free. π G • u is a J-holomorphic curve on X/ /G, but we can't use the results of[20]directly because X/ /G has orbifold singularities.For the mean value inequality, we use lemma 3.3 in[36]. The proof of this result works when the acton of K on Φ −1 (0) is locally free. In the setting of proposition B.2, this gives : there exists a number s 0 ≥ 1 2 such that for z = (s, t) ∈ {s ≥ s 0 }, e (A,u) (z) ≤ 32 π E((A, u), B 1
