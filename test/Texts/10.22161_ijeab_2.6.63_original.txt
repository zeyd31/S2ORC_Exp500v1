In order to investigate salinity stress on sorghum germination indices, an experiment conducted in the Faculty of Agriculture, Mansoura University from June and July 2017 in Agronomy Department, Seed Science Laboratory. The goals of the investigation aimed to screening for five (Sorghum bicolor L.(Moench) cultivarsviz. Dorado, hybrid 306, Giza 15, Mecca hybrid and H-305 under salinity stress, sodium chloride (Na Cl) at the levels of 0 (as control), 3, 6, 9, 12 and 15 dS/m -1 and soaking in humic acid. The results showed that soaking seed in humic acid exceeded percentage of germination, germination rate, germination index, energy of germination and chlorophyll content by 5.2, 7.7, 17.1, 65.8 and 17.8 %, respectively. The highest germination percentage (91.9 %), germination rate (3.08), germination energy (59.7), seedling vigor index (1483.7) and chlorophyll content (2.88) were obtained from sown Mecca hybrid. The maximum germination index (117.22) was obtainedfrom sown Giza 15 cultivar.The results point out that cumulative salinity level from 3 to 15 dSm -1 condensedall studied germination characters. Accumulative salinity levels to 15 dSm -1 condensedpercentage of germination, germination rate, index of germination, germination energy and seedling vigor index by 15.9, 15.0, 30.0, 35.9 and 37.6  %, respectively compared without salinity application. It could recommended that soaking sorghum seed of Meeca hybrid with humic acid for 12 h under salinity of concentration of 6 dSm -1 enhanced germination characters compared with other cultivars and salinity concentrations, it mean cultivated it under reclaimed saline soil in Egypt.

The lessening connected to the salinity rate of 12 dS/m -1 betweensorghum genotypes, the greatest in terms of germination parameters were Kimia, Sepideh, and Payam genotypes. Salinity stress significantly influencedmost germination traits and reduced the germination related the same characters (Sawamery and Mojaddam, 2014). The highest percentage of germination produced from the control, but the lowest onesobtained from 1.5% salinity level. The sensitive cultivar to salinity produced from Barbarei cultivars compared to Tabat and Wad-Ahmed cultivars, Tab at cultivar was recorded themost-salt tolerant cultivars (Siddig and Idris, 2015).Therefore, the goals of this exploration intended to study the performance of seed viability of studied sorghum cultivars under salinity stresses.


II. MATERIALS AND METHODS


Treatments and Experimental Design:

A laboratory experiment carried out in the Faculty of Agriculture, Mansoura University from June 2017 to July 2017 in Agronomy Department, Seed Science Laboratory. The aimed of the investigation conducted to screening forfive (Sorghum bicolor L.(Moench) cultivars i.e. Dorado, hybrid 306, Giza 15, Mecca hybrid and H-305 under salinity stress, Na Cl at the levels of 3, 6,9, 12 and 15 dS/m -1 beside the control, soaked or non-soaked in humic acid.The conducted experimentwas assignedto factorial experiment in RCBDin four replication. The first factorcontain two treatments with and without soaking in humic acid. The second factor includesthe five-grain sorghum cultivars i.e. Dorado, hybrid 306, Giza 15, Mecca hybrid and H-305 obtained from ARC Ministry of Agriculture. The third factor contained withinfive different levels of NaCl include 0, 3, 7, 11 and 15 dS/m -1 . The experiment comprised 240Petri dishes assigned in factorial experiment of Randomized Complete Block Design (RCBD). Then, the Petri dishes placed in a growth chamber for 14 days at 28 ± C º for germination according to ISTA, 2013 roles.


Studied characters:

The studied of germination parameters as follows: 


5-Average of seedling vigor index (SVI)was measured according toAbdel Baki and Anderson (1970)formula.

6-Total chlorophyll (SPAD): Average of total chlorophyll (SPAD) in seedling leaf samples assessed by SPAD-502 (Minolta Co. Ltd., Osaka, Japan).


Statistical Analysis:

According to the technique of variance (ANOVA) for the factorial in RCBD as published by Gomez and Gomez (1991)of the subjected data was statistically analyzed.LSDmethod was used as defined by Snedecor and Cochran (1980) the.The data analyzed statisticallyin RCBD design by MSTAT-C computer package as described by Russel (1986).


III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS 3.1. Humic acid soaking effect:

The results presented in Table (1) clearly showed that soaking in humic acid significantly affected studied germination parameters and chlorophyll content, except seedling vigor index insignificantly affected. Soaking seed in humic acid exceeded germination %, germination rate, germination index, energy of germination and chlorophyll content by 5.2, 7.7, 17.1, 65.8 and 17.8 %, respectively. Extra of 90% from seeds germinated after five days with soaking of 100-ppm potassium humate, for 24 hours (Ali and Elbordiny, 2009).Priming of wheat seed with humic produced higher percent seed germination as compared to priming seeds in alone water (Ali et al., 2014).


Cultivars performance:

The outcomes of statistical analysis was presented in Table (1) clearly revealed that studied sorghum cultivars significantly affected studied germination parameters and chlorophyll content. The highest germination percentage (91.9 %), germination rate (3.08), energy of germination (59.7), seedling vigor index (1483.7) and chlorophyll content (2.88) were obtained from sown Mecca hybrid.  et al., 2012). The more tolerant of salinity stress produced from Hoars cultivar followed by Mabrouk cultivar, which will cultivate under new reclaimed saline soils (Kandil, et al.,  2012). Germination percentage was clearly demonstrated varietal differences (Khan et al., 2014).


Salinity level effects:

The outcomes of statistical analysis was presented in Table (1) clearly revealed that salinity concentration significantly affected studied germination parameters, except chlorophyll content insignificantly affected. The results indicated that increasing salinity concentration from 3 to 15 dSm -1 significantly condensed the percentage of germination, and germination rate, germination index, energy of germination and seedling vigor index. The highest germination percentage (73.7 %), germination rate (2.46), germination index (122.5), energy of germination (52.0) and seedling vigor index (1166.8) were produced from the control treatment. However, the lowest percentage of germination (62.0 %), germination rate (2.09), germination index (85.26), energy of germination (33.3) and seedling vigor index (727.9) were produced from the highest salinity concentration of 15 dSm -1 . Increasing salinity concentration to 15 dSm -1 significantly decreased germination (%), germination rate, germination index, energy of germination and seedling vigor index by 15.9, 15.0, 30.0, 35.9 and 37.6 %, respectively compared with the control treatment. It exercises an adverse effect of osmotic inhibition and ionic toxicity (Munns et al.,  2006).  


Interaction effects:


Interaction between humic acid soaking and cultivars effects:

Regarding to the interaction between humic acid soaking and studied sorghum cultivars, the results clearly revealed that this interaction significantly affected the moststudied germination parameters and chlorophyll content, however, germination index, insignificantly affected. The results graphically illustrated in Figs. 1, 2 and 4 indicated that highest germination percentage (96.33 %) and germination rate (3.20), seedling vigor index (1646.7) were produced from sownMecca hybrid when soaked with humic acid. In addition, energy of germination (92.83) and chlorophyll content (3.81) were obtainedfrom sown Giza 15 cultivar when soaked with humic acid as shown in Fig. 3 and 5. Whereas, the lowest germination percentage (31.33 %), energy of germination (5.50), seedling vigor index (375.46) were produced from sown Giza 15 cultivar without soaking in humic acid as shown

INTRODUCTION Sorghum is one of the most important staple food crops especially in the drier and smaller areas of the semi-arid Tropics of Africa (Ali et al. 2011).Salinity is adversely affecting crop yield of crops to various extents of Egypt and the World. To overcome the shortage of cereal productivity. It could have achieved by growing grain sorghum cultivars tolerant of salinity to get economical yields from saline reclaimed soils, particularly in early seedling stages is very important. Soil salinization is a great determinate factor of crop productivity, especially in dried area (Ahmed, 2009).Many physiological variations are induced germination percentage and affecting seedling growth and development(Saroj and Soumana, 2014). Seed germination positively affected by humic acid soaking and resulted more root length. Germination testes using various levels of humic extract, the doses higher than 20% v/v repressed seed germination (Asenjo et al., 2000).Extraof 90% from seeds germinated after five days with soaking of 100-ppm potassium humate, for 24 hours (Ali and Elbordiny, 2009).Wheat seed primed with humic enhanced the germination and produced higher germination% as compared to that soakedin water (Ali et al., 2014). The highest percentage of germination gone to Sepideh cultivar and the less percentages of germination fitted to Payam cultivar under stress conditions (Mohammadi and Mojaddam, 2014).The inhibiting effect of salt on the seed germination improved in variable degrees by pretreatment of humic acid(Çavuşoğlu and Ergin, 2015). The recommended cultivar for new reclaimed saline soils were Soavecultivar (Almodares et al., 2007). Genotypes of235461 and 69239recorded the less germination rate and the great percentages of germination (Geressu and Gezahagne, 2008).Delay in germination time due to salinity stress. Maximum germination percentage produced from KFS4 cultivar (Aishah et al., 2010). Genotypes differed from salt sensitive to germination percentage(Asfaw, 2011).Sorghum genotypes differed from response to salinity, the medium tolerant recorded by cultivars of Hegari and JS-263, while the less sensitive produced from Noor cultivar and the sensitive produced from FJ-115 and PSV-4 cultivars(Kausar et al., 2012).The STI, GMP and MP genotypes were better to cultivate salinity and unsolidity stress(Hefny et al., 2013).The highest germination percentage recorded from Meko, Gambella1107, ICSV-111 and Melkam varieties and were more salt tolerant cultivars. However, ESH-2 and Go bye varieties were salt sensitive. The rest sorghum varieties were middle in their salt tolerance (Tigabo et al., 2013). Sown Shallu, Desert Maize, and 1790E genotypes graded the most salt tolerant cultivars, while the least salt tolerance genotypes produced from Schrock and RTx430 cultivars(Sun et al., 2014). Salinity at a rate of 300 mM, the time of germination of CSF 18 variety increased, but germination speed and germination test variables decreased. The CSF 20 variety was in the same trend, except for the speed germination and the time of germination, which influenced by sodium chloride at the 150 mM level. The CSF 18 variety had more tolerance to salinity than CSF 20 variety during the germination stage(De oliveir and Gomes-Filho, 2009).The percentage of germination increased from thelowest level of salinity (2 dS/m -1 ), while inhibited the germination % atsalinity levels of 4, 8 and 16 dS/m -1 . Wad Ahmed cultivar recorded the more salt tolerant, but Arfagadamak and Butana cultivars were the more salt sensitive (El Naim et al., 2012).The germination percentage decreased with salinity concentrations increased. The lowest germination percentage produced from CSV-15 and Pant-1 cultivars at highest salinity level(Chauhan et al., 2012).KFS2, KFS4 genotypes produced the highest rate of germination. LFS56 genotype recorded the lowest rate of germination by the 10% (Tabatabaei and Anagholi, 2012). SSV84 cultivar recorded the highest salt tolerant variety and the highest percentage of germination produced from IS6973 cultivar (Almodares et al., 2014).A significant reduced from germination characteristics of sorghum triggered by salinity.The percentage of germination, germination rate and time of germination were decreased with salinity concentration increased (Behzadnejad and Tohidinejad, 2014).The rate of germination and germination percentage decreased as salinity levels increased. Germination parameters were the lowest at salinity level of 9 and 12 dS/m -1 (Dadar et al., 2014).Seed germination reduced at 1.5% NaCl treatment. Germinating percentage reduced by 35.8% in higher salt concentrations (Sam et al., 2014).


index (GI) was calculated according to Karim et al. (1992)equation.4-The energy of germination (EG) wasmeasured according toRuan et al., (2002).


The highest germination index (117.22) was produced from sown Giza 15 cultivar. However, the lowest germination percentage (40.8 %), germination rate (1.35), germination index (77.97), energy of germination (15.9) and seedling vigor index (481.9). While, the lowest chlorophyll content (2.20) was produced from sown Dora cultivar. The recommended cultivar was Soave for soils with high salinity (Almodares et al., 2007). NM-92 cultivar was more adaptability under saline conditions (Ahmed, 2009). The time of germination of CSF 18 variety increased at salinity of 300 mM, but the speed of germination and germination test variables decreased. The CSF 20 variety was in the same trend, except for the speed germination and the time of germination, which influenced by NaCl at the 150 mM level. The CSF 18 variety had better tolerance to salt stress during the germination stage than CSF 20 (De oliveir and Gomes-Filho, 2009). Deferral in germination time related to salinity, the highest germination percentage produced from KFS4 cultivar (Aishah et al., 2010). Genotypes differed from salt sensitive to germination percentage (Asfaw, 2011). The percentage of germination increased from the lowest level of salinity (2 dS/m -1 ), while inhibited the germination percentage of salinity levels of 4, 8 and 16 dS/m -1 . Wad Ahmed cultivar recorded the more salt tolerant, but Arfagadamak and Butana cultivars were the more salt sensitive (El Naim


germination and germination ratedecreased as salinity levels were increased (Jamil et al., 2006).Percentage of germination reduced and time of germination increased due salinity stress(Jajarmi. 2007).The germination percentage decreased with salinity concentrations increased. The lowest germination percentage produced from CSV-15 and Pant-1 cultivars at highest salinity level(Chauhan et al., 2012). The KFS2 and KFS4 varieties produced the maximum rate of germination.. LFS56 variety showed the lowest rate of germination by the 10% (Tabatabaei and Anagholi, 2012). Salt stress unfavorablydistressesseedling at germination stage (Hussain et al., 2013).These results from good agreement with those reported by Noreen and Ashraf (2008), Almodares et al. (2014), Behzadnejad and Tohidinejad (2014), Dadar et al. (2014) and Sam et al.(2014).

while the intermediate sensitive produced from Noor cultivar and the sensitive produced from FJ-115 and PSV-4 cultivars (Kausar et al., 2012). During germination of Meko, Gambella1107, ICSV-111 and Melkam varieties were extra salt tolerant. However, ESH-2 and Gobye varieties were salt sensitive. The respite varieties were midway in their salt tolerance (Tigabo et al., 2013). SSV84 cultivar recorded the highest salt tolerant variety and the highest percentage of germination produced from IS6973 cultivar and moderate seedling characters and classified as moderate salt tolerant (Almodares et al., 2014). Inter cultivars genetic variation and concentration x cultivars interaction showed significant differences for all studied parameters (Khan et al., 2014). Similarly, many investigators such as Dadar et al. (2014), Sam et al. (2014), Sawamery and Mojaddam (2014), Siddig and Idris (2015) reported similar results.International Journal of Environment, Agriculture and Biotechnology (IJEAB)
