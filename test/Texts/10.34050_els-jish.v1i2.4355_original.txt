This study is appointed to report the English teacher's understanding of teaching productive skills through Neuro-Linguistics Programming. Neuro-Linguistics Programming as one of the approach in teaching English as a foreign language, with focusing on the brain anatomy, and it can stimulate student's creative thinking, language uses, and motivation. Productive skills are need to be fostered by the students in learning English as a foreign language, because writing, and speaking are the most essential language skills. This research is uses qualitative descriptive method, with triangulation model in doing validity and reliability data. There are some steps applied in this research; Planning, observation, interviews, giving questionnaire, and the last is data analysis. The researcher focuses on the English lecturers who have taught English more than 2 years as subjects of the research. 7 questions in close -ended answer (yes/no answer) are given and 5 questions in short answer interview are implemented to gain the data regarding to lecturer's understanding in NLP concept for teaching productive skills. 23 English Lecturers both male and female are to be the subjects of the research. From the data analysis, the result shows that almost of English lecturers know the NLP approach in teaching language, and they always give brain storming as a part of NLP concepts.

Introduction

Language is not only a tool to communicate in delivering the message, but also a part of culture. Furthermore, a good process is needed to learn language, to make the message is deliver and understandable by the societies, and it also can show the a good identity of notion through the use of a good language.

Learning language need to a specific approach or method, because learning language is not same with learning mathematics or chemistry. According to Kumaradivelu (2006;100) learning language consist of 4 categories: 1) learning language as a learning to drive, so in this case there is no fix and systematic rule, but the need of drilling, practice and motivation to learn. 2) Learning language as a process from a habit mechanism to drilling. In forming those habits can improve the language skills from sub skills, such as words, sound, sentence structure, meaning and etc. 3) a form of habit as ability in doing analysis, problem analysis, knowing some aspects of language uses. 4) Learning language is integration, it cannot be separated from any others sub skills.

To be able to acquire the language, in the process of learning we need a quality teacher to guide and teach. A professional teacher should be able to facilitate varieties of differentiation among their learners, and one of a good way is through a specific approach or method to be implemented in teaching and learning process. Neuro-Linguistics Programming (NLP) is assumes as the most suitable approach for teaching productive skill in this era, because through NLP students are encourage to involve in rising their critical thinking to solve the lesson/topic's problem. Neuro linguistics programming claimed that this approach is one of the current ways to understand learners' needs especially in teaching and learning language. According Taqwa (2016), NLP is linguistics science with interdicipline study, and it is consists of macro linguistics aspect, which is the object of study is anatomy of human brain (nervous structure) and linguistics.

Learning language usually divided into two domains of skills, they are productive skills, and receptive skills. Enlighten the student's skill can be started from receptive skills, and then they can continue to productive skills as the outcomes of their language learning. In the global communication era, the use of cross language become essential, as the result, speaking and writing skills as a foreign language is becoming widely recognized to be learnt in education, business, and others personal reason, Weigle (2002). Understanding specific approach to stimulate students productive skills are very emergence, because to practice their productive skills, such as writing and speaking are very hard, although they have already learnt many times. Furthermore, speaking skill as a communicative ability should be mastered by students to encourage their critical thinking of language use. Practice the speaking skill will involve two steps of learning, they are receptive and interaction, while the interaction is the productive, Arjulayana and Srikandi (2016). In the other hands speaking can encourage student's critical thinking and problem solving if they can practice it properly supported by Neuro-Linguistics Programming which is focus on student's brain capacity and quality.

Another productive skill is writing. Through writing student can express their ideas and planning into the text. Supported by Patel and Jain (2008:125), Writing as the essential skill in language learning, because it provides good means of foxing vocabulary, spelling, sentence structure, and others.


Literature Review


Understanding Productive Skills

Productive skills are language term which is provides of two main skills, they are writing and speaking. This domain of skill is very crucial, because the outcomes of learning language are productive skills. People will not know student's language quality after learning, if they cannot show their productive skills. Productive skills are consisting of speaking skill and writing skill, while the listening skill and reading skills are receptive skill, Harmer (2017). Those multiple language skills can be mastered by the students better if the teacher can implement a good approach. Writing and speaking as productive skill can encourage student's creativity and critical thinking. Teacher should adopt a good procedure to stimulate student's productive skills, it can be through game or hypnotherapy, as NLP suggested.

Writing skill as one of the hardest skill for student who difficult to express their though through the text, Arjulayana and Srikandi (2006). To enhance the writing skill, practice and drilling are needed, because there is no good result without any practice. In this term also, teacher can make some drafts to encourage student's writing motivation. Teacher can give six steps of small task, such as constructing play outlines; in this part teacher can suggests their students to find a topic discuss and try to put their small ideas into the text, drafting play scripts, revising play scripts, Luo (2015). Writing as the progressive skill can be a good way to express student's ideas, through writing many sub skills of language also can be mastered, such as vocabulary, spelling, sentence structure and many others.

In this global community, students and teachers should be able to interact with international language user, coherence with the English as a corpora language. Those interactions can be directly or indirectly, in indirect interaction writing skill is needed. Paraphrasing of ideas into the text also can be practiced by the teacher to foster student's willingness in doing writing. Hence, writing skill is important and easier to be practiced if students have role model and motivator to stimulate them in doing it.

In digitalize era, English speaking also becoming essential skill for every single nation. Speaking practice can foster student's micro linguistic and macro linguistics, such as vocabulary, pronunciation, phonology, morphology, semantics, and others. Speaking as a productive skill is appear after receptive skill, because students will not be able to speak without listening some vocabulary, pronunciation, words structure in the beginning. So the highest stage of skill is speaking, Ampa at.al (2013). In speaking mechanism students are not only required to be able to understand the linguistics competence, such as grammar or word structure, vocabulary, pronunciation, but also sociolinguistics competence, such when they have to speak, why they have to speak and responses people arguments, what speaking they should to convey, how to speak correctly, Burn & Joyce (1997).


Definition of Neuro-Linguistics Programming

In teaching and learning process, implementing the specific approach or method is very crucial to gain the objectives of study as the expectation. NLP begins from two scientists who met in California University at 1970; Dr. Richard Bandler as the expert of computer programming, and Dr.Jhon Grinder as psychology's professor. They interest in analyzing people who can influence others, and how people can imitate someone's behavior which called modeling. Learning mental process relate with people condition, how they can interact with very similar way and attractive as the instructor suggests, Revell.J & Norman.S (1997).

NLP can be implemented in communicative and developing student's capacity and quality, because NLP claims there were integrated between neuron, linguistics, and form of behavior experiences as the programming in human life. NLP approach involves the use of language, thinking strategy, and creativity in learning process, Farahani (2018). This approach is not only involves in language skills, and thinking strategy, but also can guide student's belief, behavior, and competency in accurate communication, Baker and Rinvolucri (2005).

As the potential approach NLP can be implemented in wide range, such as education, business, and also trainer. Propose for the language learning especially in productive skill, NLP encourage student to use their strategic thinking, and creatively in comprehending the lesson. Neuro refers to human brain, how the brain works, thinking and mental organize. So, the neuro will provides the brain and mental process regarding to human activity. Linguistics is a study of language aspects, both micro and macro language. How people can use language properly, whether in communication, or producing the language meaning. Programming is the structure or mental process to attract human mind in changing their behavior and achieving the expectable goals, this term relate to a capacity in modifying mental process. NLP as the current technic in teaching can be assumed as the current technology in framing the achievement. NLP as the current way to show the encouragement, thought, as the software tools in human brain to interpret the experiences, Romo (2014).

NLP which is refers to nervous system as the interrelated among 5 senses, while linguistics refers to human ability in communication naturally, either verbal or nonverbal communication. Verbal communication here means communication relate with words selection, phrase, sentence structure, so it can shows people mental through their language use. kemampuan alami manusia dalam melakukan komunikasi baik secara verbal atau non verbal, and nonverbal communication here refers to "silence language" such as; gesture, body language, and behavior, so it can produce thinking style. Programming also refers to paradigm ,and behavior, which is influenced from human experiences.


Procedure And Technique Of NLP In Teaching Productive Skills

Teaching process is not as simple as our thought, because a process of teaching, need well preparation, documentation form, knowledge and readiness. To provide the well prepare in the beginning teacher should determine the approach or method used. Without preparation and specific method, the process of teaching will blur and will not achieve the objective of study. NLP as a creative approach has some technics in teaching productive skills, because in NLP there is no gap between knowledge and thinking capacity. Writing through story and speaking through story can be implemented by NLP; in this term students are stimulated to use processing software with supportive words.

Before teaching teacher can apply some steps to encourage student's focus, such as pacing and leading. Pacing is the process when the teacher tries to instruct the students to equalize position, body language, language use and brain waves. This steps can be simulated as follow; 1) imagine the age between students and teacher are same, 2) use the common language as the students use in their daily, 3) use body movement and mimic based on the topic discuss, 4) integrate the theme which is being happening to students, 5) teacher tries to update information, which is trending among students. Leading as the second step can be used in positive response and positive words to students, as teacher's support. This step teacher can use some principles, such as; 1) Integration principle, teacher should be able to integrate the material teaching to the real condition, 2) differentiation principle; this term teacher tries to stimulate students to find differentiation among student's ideas. 3) Self-regulated, this term teacher can advise their students to be able to manage their emotional and behavior.

Technic of NLP can be implemented in all professions; lecturer especially implements the NLP to stimulate student's thinking strategic, creativity, and pattern of thinking, Taqwa (2016). Some techniques can be implemented in teaching productive skill through NLP; 1) face the state, lecturer can give brain storming/ice breaking in the beginning, so in this technique students are stimulated to be focus but relax, and then lecturer continues to pace the ongoing process, it is appreciate the condition verbally and nonverbally, depend on the reality. 2) Lead to the desire state, in this technique lecturer should be able to identify students' condition, lecturer guide the students to gain their best condition, relax, readiness to get the information, passion and high curiosity to follow the learning process. This step lecturer can use song, watching a short video or body movement. 3) fire the anchor, this technique can be implemented in certain situation, when the lecturer assumes that teaching and learning process is not conducive, boring, students are sleepy, lecturer can give short question, or showing the colorful slide, and quiz to stimulate students' visual, auditory, and kinesthetic work. 4) Nested loop, in this technique lecturer can requires students to write and speak all about material they have learnt in the beginning process of learning until the end, or lecturer can ask students to associate the topic discuss with the previous topic, and then they can practice their writing skill or speaking skill. 5) Future pacing, this technique can be proposed as the dreaming and planning ideas. Lecturer suggests their students to bring their thought in future time, where this knowledge can be useful in future condition, or for next generation. This technique also can be implemented through VAKGO scheme; it is Visual, Auditory, Kinesthetic, Gustatory, and Olfactory. In conclusion, this technique can stimulate all aspect of human body; it can guide human body to work properly.


Research Method


Research Design

In every single research, the design of the research method is essential, because research design as the guide line in doing the research. In doing the research, researcher will present the research methodology and the research's method. Research methodology is s systematic way in solving the research problem, for instance, it can be said as the scientific understanding of how research is done scientifically, Kothari (2004). Another is the research method which is refers to all methods and techniques that are used to conduct the research, Kothari (2004).

This research is a qualitative descriptive method, with a purposive sampling design, and 23 English lecturers are to be selected as subjects of the research both female and male lecturers to answer some of interviews indirectly relate with their understanding of NLP concept in teaching productive skills. This study represents the data based on the indirect interviews and researcher's judgment based on the experience in around university she taught. As the qualitative research this method can be used for researcher, if it can be representative the population. For example a judgment sample of college students to know the reaction of new method of teaching, in line with definition of judgment sampling, Kothari (2004) states that is it use for qualitative research where it happens to develop the hypothesis rather than generalize the population.

To collect the data, researcher gives 7 questions in close question-answer (yes/no answer only), related with their understanding of NLP, the need of giving brainstorming/ice breaking in the beginning of teaching and learning process, their understanding of the importance to giving brain storming in teaching and learning process, to know whether the English lecturers have ever used NLP in their teaching process; teaching writing, and teaching speaking, to know English lecturer's understanding of NLP concept to foster student's creativity and thinking strategy, and to measure English lecturer's understanding of pacing and leading based on the NLP concept in teaching and learning process. 5 questions of short answer questions also given to the subjects of the research to know their ideas and suggestions regarding to NLP concept in teaching productive skills. Those questions relate with their ideas, and approach in teaching productive skills, their ideas about the importance of giving brain storming to higher education students whether in the beginning, middle, or last of teaching and learning process.

Credibility of data is done to check the validity of instruments. In this research, the credibility is done using source triangulation. The instruments is given to the subject of the research, doing interviews in short answer questions, and close ended question (yes/no answer only), observation to get the similarities from different source.


Data Analysis

The main objective of this research was to find out and report the lecturer's understanding of NLP concept for teaching productive skills. Based on the data collection, almost of the English lecturers who participate in this research were teaching English more than 10 years.

The analysis data based on the question shows, those 60.9% English lecturers known the NLP concept, but a part of them do not use NLP in teaching productive skills. 39.1% they doubt in implementing NLP to teach speaking skill, 34.8% they never used NLP concept, and 26.1% is ever used NLP in teaching speaking. In teaching writing skill, 39.1% the participant never use NLP, 34.8% they used NLP, and 26.1% is doubt. They agree with NLP for teaching productive skill, because it can improve student's creativity. It shown from their answer 60.9% is agreeing on that statement and 39.1% is doubt. Giving motivation through pacing and leading to the students while teaching is very significant answer, 69.9% participants are agreeing, and 30.4 % is doubly.

From the short answer questions, some English lecturers also give suggestions regarding to the NLP concept for teaching productive skills. Almost of the participants suggest to give stimulate with collaborative learning in practice their writing, but before practicing it lecturer should guide the students' imagination through 4 steps of writing, such as planning, first draft to develop the idea in the beginning, writing draft revision, and final draft. NLP is seldom to be practiced by the English lecturer; it might be their understanding of NLP is insufficient. So, in teaching speaking almost of them use Collaborative, and communicative approach to encourage student's willingness and some of them also use role model technique, to make their students are easier to imitate.

In the other statement, almost of the English lecturers are agree to use NLP for teaching productive skills, but they need to understand the concept on NLP, and the technique used. The last question is related with their understanding of the function giving brain storming to students. They assume giving brain storming is important, because it can stimulate students' creativity and imagination in developing their ideas, to open student's apperception about the material which is going to be learnt, and to boost the students' focus before starting the teaching and learning process.


Findings

From the data analysis, the result can be drawn, that almost of English lecturers know the NLP, but the concept how to implement it in teaching productive skills is still low. They need to understand more about NLP concept for teaching productive skills, because almost of the participants are interested in NLP concept but almost of them are never use NLP in teaching and learning process. They prefer to use brain storming in the beginning of teaching and learning process, but they do not know, that brain storming as a part of NLP concept.


Discussion

Whether in productive skills or in receptive skills, NLP is quite suitable to be implemented by the English lecturers in teaching English. The previous study is done with the title the Effect of Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP) on Reading Comprehension in English for Specific Purposes Courses by Fehimeh Farahani (2018). In her research states that NLP is a good approach to help students in learning English, because it has receive attention fully. Furthermore, NLP concept also suggested by Rosemarin (2016), in her research states that NLP approach offers modeling tools to students and teachers to identify the material of learing specifically, reproducing the strategic thinking in language use and behavior to be the role models in acquire the language learning, and the most essential is students become creative.

The research findings of NLP shows, almost of the English lecturers knew the brainstorming, or pacing, and leading in the process of teaching and learning, but possibility, they do not know the name of the approach they implemented. This diagram shows that English lecturers need to comprehend the NLP for teaching productive skills;


Figure1. NLP's comprehension in Teaching Productive Skills

Have you ever used the NLP model approach in teaching speaking skills?

Have you ever used the NLP model approach in teaching writing skills? From the diagrams above show, practicing NLP in teaching productive skill is quite low, than lecturer who never practice the NLP. This phenomenon happens, because their understanding of NLP is still low. Through this paper, the writer tries to promote the NLP approach to be used by the English lecturer to teach productive skills.


Conclusion

The conclusion of this research stated, that NLP as an approach in modeling technique can be implemented for teaching langanguage, especially teaching productive skills. NLP can stimulate students' thinking strategic in using language, which the correct words selection, sentence pattern, behavior, and critical thinking. NLP can integrate nervouse system, through this concept the lecturers can control and motivate their students to learn seriousely, but relex. Lecturers need to understand the concept of NLP to develop students productive skills and make the teaching and learning process are different with usual process.
