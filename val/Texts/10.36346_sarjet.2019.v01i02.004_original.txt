Neural networks are a new generation of information processing paradigms designed to mimic some of the behaviours of the human brain. These networks have gained tremendous popularity due to their ability to learn, recall and generalize from training data. A number of neural network paradigms have been reported in the last four decades, and in the last decade the neural networks have been refined and widely used by researchers and application engineers. This study focuses on the prediction of the elongation % and Ultimate Tensile Strength (UTS) of the dissimilar Friction Stir Welded joints of aluminium alloys by training the Neural Network on Quasi Newton Algorithm.

INTRODUCTION

Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is a set of processing units which are assembled together in a closely interconnected network. It strikingly offers same features as biological neurons. Neural networks learn from examples. For example, before solving any exercise of mathematical problems, students train their mind from examples available in the particular chapter. After training their minds on the basis of learning procedures to solve problems, they jump on exercise part. Massive parallel problems can be solved by Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). An artificial neural network (ANN) is a simplified model of the structure of the biological neural network. Interconnected processing units constitute the Artificial Neural Network.

A typical artificial neural network architecture is shown in the Figure 1.

Nowadays, in the field welding process,artificial neural network(ANN) modeling has gained increased importance. DUTTA et al. [1] simulated the gas tungsten arc welding process by using conventional regression analysis and neural network tools and concluded that the performance of ANN was better compared with regression analysis. ATES et al. [2] depicted the use of artificial neural network for predicting the welding parameters in gas metal arc welding. OKUYUCU et al [3] presented the possibility of the use of neural networks in order to calculate the mechanical properties of friction stir welded(FSW) aluminium plates with the help of the process parameters such as rotational speed and welding speed. Tnasel et al. [4] used Genetically Optimized Neural Network System in order to estimate the optimal operating condition of the Friction Stir Welding process. He introduced GONNS by using Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Genetic Algorithm together,. Friction Stir Welding (FSW) process was presented by him in five artificial neural networks (ANN. The results showed that the inputs of the five ANNs were the same (tool rotation and welding feed rate).

In our present study, we carried out Friction Stir Welding process on dissimilar alloys of Aluminium i.e. AA6061 and AA7075 alloys. The elongation % and Ultimate Tensile Strength of the dissimilar joint was predicted by training the Neural Network on Quasi Newton algorithm.


Experimental Procedure

In this study, 6061-T6 and 7075 aluminium alloys of the dimensions 100 mm X 50 mm X 6 mm were used as base metals. Aluminium alloy plates were machined to required dimensions for butt welding.

Box plots display information about the minimum, maximum, first quartile, second quartile or median and third quartile of every variable in the data set. They consist of two parts: a box and two whiskers. The length of the box represents the interquartile range (IQR), which is the distance between the third quartile and the first quartile.

Constant variables are those columns in the data matrix having always the same value. They do not provide any information to the model but increase its complexity. Constant variables should neither be used as inputs nor as targets, except when the model will need to include them in the future. There are not constant variables in the data set. Repeated instances are those rows in the data matrix having the same values as other rows. They provide redundant information to the model and should not be used for training, selection or testing. There are no repeated instances in the data set. The maximum distance to the center of the data that is going to be allowed is defined by the cleaning parameter. As it grows, the test becomes less sensitive to outliers but if it is too small, a lot of values will be detected as outliers. The data has not outliers. This task trains a neural network using all the instances, then set as unused the instances that have an error above a given value. Note that the instances are arranged in rows of 10. The total number of instances is 15. The numbers of training, selection, testing and unused instances are 10, 2, 2 and 1, respectively.

The following pie chart details the uses of all the instances in the data set. There are 10 instances for training (66.7%), 2 instances for selection (13.3%), 2 instances for testing (13.3%) and 1 unused instance (6.67%).

Principal components analysis allows to identify underlying patterns in a data set so it can be expressed in terms of other data set of lower dimension without much loss of information. The resulting data set should be able to explain most of the variance of the original data set by making a variable reduction. The final variables will be named principal components. Since this process is not reversible, it will be only applied to the input variables.

The next chart shows the cumulative explained variance for the principal components. The x-axis represents each of the principal components and the y-axis depicts the cumulative explained variance. As it can be seen, the total explained variance for all the principal components is 100% but if the number of chosen principal components decreases also makes it the total explained variance.

The quasi-Newton method is used here as training algorithm. It is based on Newton's method, but does not require calculation of second derivatives. Instead, the quasi-Newton method computes an approximation of the inverse Hessian at each iteration of the algorithm, by only using gradient information. The following figure depicts the losses in each iteration. The initial value of the training loss is 1.09861, and the final value after 87 iterations is 0.109506. The initial value of the selection loss is 67.587, and the final value after 87 iterations is 154.445.

The next table shows the training results by the quasi-Newton method. They include some final states from the neural network, the loss functional and the training algorithm. 


MODEL SELECTION

Model selection is applied to find a neural network with a topology that optimizes the loss on new data. There are two different types of algorithms for model selection: Order selection algorithms and input selection algorithms. Order selection algorithms are used to find the optimal number of hidden neurons in the network. Inputs selection algorithms are responsible for finding the optimal subset of input variables.The inputs selection algorithm chosen for this application is growing inputs. With this method, the inputs are added progressively based on their correlations with the targets.The order selection algorithm chosen for this application is incremental order. This method starts with the minimum order and adds a given number of perceptrons in each iteration.

Input importance task calculates the selection loss when removing one input at a time. This shows which input have more influence in the outputs.The next table shows the importance of each input. If the importance takes a value greater than 1 for an input, it means that the selection error without that input is greater than with it. In the case that the importance is lower than 1, the selection error is lower without using that input. Finally, if the importance is 1, there is no difference between using the current input and not using it. The most important variable is Welding Speed (mm/min), that gets a contribution of 123.3% to the outputs.


Table-14: Inputs importance results

The next chart illustrates the contribution of each input.

The best selection is achieved by using a model whose complexity is the most appropriate to produce an adequate fit of the data. The order selection algorithm is responsible of finding the optimal number of neurons in the network. Incremental order is used here as order selection algorithm in the model selection. The next chart shows the loss history for the different subsets during the incremental order selection process. The blue line represents the training loss and the red line symbolizes the selection loss.
