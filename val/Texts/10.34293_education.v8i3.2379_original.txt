Limitations

Due to time and cost constraints the study was in 4 months. There is a chance for bias in the aspects of data collection and analysis,

The study was conducted during the period of examinations and vacation. Therefore, the researcher is unable to include many students for the study.

Students hesitate to share their views regarding various applications of their smartphones because they are unauthorized to use their smartphones.


Scope for Future Study

• Because of the limited time and cost the study was conducted among the very few students (186) the study can be further extended by including some more number of respondents. • Future studies can also include school students; now they are also using many applications for their study purpose and entertainment. • The study can compare the students of various districts and states to know their efficient use of artificial intelligence. • The future study can also compare the uses and the various applications used by school students with college students.


Wrapping Up

The present study aimed to analyze the various uses of Artificial Intelligence in Smart Phones used by the students. The study discussed the different uses, applications, and security features in smartphones among the students enrolled in higher education. Most of the universities and colleges banned the usage of smartphones inside the campus because of the study and security purpose. The students using smartphones in the colleges disturbed themselves by lack of concentration and also disturbing others because of their attitudes. Thus the educational institutions are not allowing the students to use their phones in their institutions. But the students are commonly using their smartphones along with their friends. They are very familiar with the updated versions of artificial intelligence. From the study, it is clear that most of the students in professional education are using smartphones for their academic purposes. The majority of students belong to the age group of 18 to 20 years are using smartphones, maybe because of their age factor entertainment ranked first in their uses. The number of students using online financial transactions is high shows that students are more interested to participate in digital India and join their hands to take part in corruption-free economy. Though there are many threats in the use of artificial intelligence, the students are having awareness about the various security features and they are also using these features to secure their money and hide their personal information. Instead of avoiding the smart phones in the colleges, the institutions and the faculty members can guide the students to use artificial intelligence for their knowledge and career development with ethics and morals. The government can also take necessary steps to stop the unethical use of artificial intelligence to avoid threats and cyber crimes.
