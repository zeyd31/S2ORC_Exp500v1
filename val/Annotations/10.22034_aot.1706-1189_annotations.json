We call them Lambert and proto-Lambert spaces and pay more attention to the latter ones. The considered two tensor products lead to essentially different norms in the respective spaces. Moreover, the proto-Lambert tensor product is especially nice for spaces with the maximal proto-Lambert norm and in particular, for L 1 -spaces. At the same time the Lambert tensor product is nice for Hilbert spaces with the minimal Lambert norm."
