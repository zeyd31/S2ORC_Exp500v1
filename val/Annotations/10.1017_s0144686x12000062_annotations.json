We investigate potential causes of this drop in charitable giving among the oldest old including changes in health, cognition, egocentric networks, religious attendance, and substitution of charitable bequest planning. A longitudinal analysis of data from the United States Health and Retirement Survey indicates that the drop in charitable giving is mediated largely by changes in the frequency of church attendance, with only modest influences from changes in health and cognition.

The positive relationship between age and prosocial behaviour can largely be accounted for by lifecycle effects, such as higher levels of income and more leisure time that become available with older age (Barlow and Hainsworth ; Schervish, Havens and O'Herlihy ). Having more financial resources and time available has a positive influence on the amount of time and money spent helping others and supporting non-profit organisations (Bekkers and Wiepking ). In addition, some studies also find evidence for a cohort effect: more recent cohorts are increasingly active at an older age (Broese Van Groenou and Deeg ; Einolf ; Knulst and Eijck ). Broese Van Groenou and Deeg () show that the social participation rates of --year-olds in the Netherlands in  were significantly higher than those of their agepeers in . The increased social participation in the  cohort can be explained by their higher average level of educational attainment and by their increased retirement age compared with the  cohort. Using longitudinal data, Einolf () predicts that in the United States of America (USA) the generation of baby-boomers (born -) will be more active volunteers in the near future than the generations born - or born - were at the same ages.With the large generation of baby-boomers arriving at or approaching retirement, this gives great promise for the future of the non-profit sector in Western societies (Havens and Schervish ). However, it remains to be seen whether this demographic trend is actually as positive for the financial support of the non-profit sector as it seems at first glance. Although age has generally been positively associated with charitable giving, when the overall positive linear trend is examined more closely, studies commonly find that the positive relationship between age and charitable giving becomes negative at the oldest ages. Several studies have found that charitable giving to non-profit organisations increases with age until age  and then declines with further age (Andreoni ; Hodgkinson and Weitzman ; Midlarsky and Hannah ). Other studies have found those over age  were less likely to be donors, such as in analyses of a national survey in Taiwan (Wu, Huang and Kao ), in analyses of charitable giving tax data in the USA (Daneshvary and Luksetich ), in a survey study of door-to-door giving in the Netherlands (Wiepking ), and in a door-to-door fundraising experiment involving , US households (Landry et al. ). Other studies have also suggested that amounts donated to charity increase until age  then decrease (Danko and Stanley ; Edmundson ; Halfpenny ).Previous research has not yet led to an understanding of the lower incidence of giving at the oldest ages.
