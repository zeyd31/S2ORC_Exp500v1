            "text": "We herein report the total course and autopsy findings of a woman who complained of chest discomfort and had plasma B-type natriuretic peptide 43 pg/mL and left ventricular outflow tract obstruction (with a resting pressure gradient of 181 mmHg) due to sigmoid septum at 73 years of age. Betaxolol and verapamil decreased her pressure gradient to 14 mmHg, but the pressure gradient (101 mmHg) again worsened. The betaxolol dose was increased and cibenzoline was added, resulting in a pressure gradient ! 21 mmHg. An autopsy was performed after death from a urinary tract infection at 80 years of age. The absence of any disarray of cardiac myocytes was confirmed."
