            "text": "The State of Iowa, located in the Midwestern United States, has experienced an increased frequency of large floods in recent decades.After extreme flooding in the summer of 2008, the Iowa Flood Center (IFC) was established for advanced research and education specifically related to floods.IFC seeks to improve Iowa's flood hazard awareness through the development of easily accessible, high-quality mapping products.Mapping initiatives consist of two model development approaches: (1) statewide floodplain delineation using one-dimensional (1D) models, and (2) urban flood mapping using detailed one-dimensional/two-dimensional (2D) coupled models.The statewide floodplain project will benefit Iowans through the creation of a comprehensive set of floodplain maps developed under a single consistent methodology.These will be important tools in evaluating flood risk, regulating floodplains, and participating in the National Flood Insurance Program.Detailed urban flood analyses are used to develop inundation map libraries.These map libraries are meant to supplement National Weather Service river stage flood forecasts by providing a visual representation of potential flood extent according to predicted river stage at stream gage locations."
