This study evaluates capture and anesthesia of moose (Alces alces) with etorphine-xylazine-acepromazine in Northern Sweden.Methods: Fifteen adult moose aged 3-15 years were darted from a helicopter with a combination of 3.37 mg etorphine, 75 mg xylazine, and 15 mg acepromazine. Paired arterial blood samples were collected 15 minutes apart with the first sample at 15-23 minutes after darting and were analyzed immediately with an i-STAT W 1 Portable Clinical Analyzer.Results: All animals developed hypoxemia (PaO 2 <10 kPa) with nine animals having marked hypoxemia (PaO 2 5.5-8 kPa). All moose were acidemic (ph<7.35) with nine moose having marked acidemia (pH<7.20). For PaCO 2, 14 moose had mild hypercapnia (PaCO 2 6-8 kPa) and two had marked hypercapnia (PaCO 2 >8 kPa). Pulse, respiratory rate, pH and HCO 3 increased significantly over time from darting whereas lactate decreased. Conclusions: The hypoxemia found in this study is a strong indication for investigating alternative drug doses or combinations or treatment with supplemental oxygen."
