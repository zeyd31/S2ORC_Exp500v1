            "text": "An orally available salicylate and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), with antiinflammatory, analgesic and antipyretic activities. As a prodrug, salsalate is hydrolyzed to salicylic acid which inhibits the expression of cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes. T his prevents the conversion of arachidonic acid into prostaglandin precursors and leads to decreased formation of prostaglandins that are involved in pain, fever and inflammation.In addition, salsalate appears to inhibit nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kB), thereby preventing activation of the NF-kB-mediated pathway and the expression of genes involved in inflammation."
