            "text": "The X-ray spectrum in a 1 • × 1 • region of the Galactic center observed with the ASCA satellite is examined in detail, following the first report by Koyama et  al. (1996, AAA 65.155.208). The observed spectrum contains prominent emission lines from helium-like and hydrogen-like ions of various elements, and is essentially the same all over the region. If the observed spectrum is thermal emission from hot plasmas, it requires multi-temperature plasma components, each at a different degree of ionization and with a different amount of absorption. The absence of adiabatic cooling and of systematic changes in the degree of ionization over the region is against the Galactic center origin of hot plasmas. A significant broadening of the helium-like and hydrogen-like iron K-lines is confirmed. The line width corresponds to a rms velocity of ∼ 3300 km s −1 , which far exceeds the sound velocity in a plasma of kT ∼ 14 keV measured with the Ginga satellite. These facts cast doubt on a thermal origin of the observed X-ray emission."
