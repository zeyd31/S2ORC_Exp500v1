The challenge of exploring novel porous materials with advanced functionalities, prompted us to develop dynamic crystalline structures promoted by soft interactions. Herein, we demonstrate the first example of a pure molecular dynamic crystalline framework held together by means of weak sticky fingers van der Waals interactions. The presented organic fullerene-based material exhibits a non-porous dynamic crystalline structure capable of undergoing single-crystal to single-crystal reactions. Exposure to hydrazine vapors induce structural and chemical changes that evince the toposelective hydrogenation of alternating rings on the surface"
