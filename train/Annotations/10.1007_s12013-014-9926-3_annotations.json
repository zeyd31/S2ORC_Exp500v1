            "text": "The treatment for AML (Acute myeloid/myelogenous leukemia) transformed from MDS (myelodysplastic syndrome) is difficult and controversial clinically, especially in elder patients. In this case report, we diagnosed a 59-year-old female patient with AML-M2a transformed form MDS which might be caused by her chemotherapy for mastocarcinoma. After achieving complete remission (CR) through combined chemotherapy, autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (auto-PBSCT) was attempted. Following auto-HSCT, marrow showed continuous CR but the patient later developed extramedullary bone-infiltration relapse. Then local radiotherapy has been applied, and the patient now has prolonged survival. This is the first (or a successful) case report of auto-HSCT in an elderly patient with AML transformed from MDS."
