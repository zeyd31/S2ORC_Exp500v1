            "text": "The wide use of copper (Cu)-based fungicide has caused a stepwise accumulation of Cu in the environment increasing the occurrence of phytotoxicity in crops. To understand and alleviate this abiotic stress, maize seedlings were grown in hydroponic solution with different combinations of Cu and iron (Fe) forms. Results showed that maize Cu sensitivity is related to the nature of the form supplied and to the chelate-exchange processes that might involve other elements, such as Fe. The use of CuSO 4 excess (100 ÂµM) caused severe reduction of plant growth, over accumulation of Cu, high activity of antioxidant enzymes, and impairment of the acquisition of other nutrients. In presence of chelating agents (citrate and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, EDTA) the ability of plants to tolerate high Cu-levels depends on the Fe nutritional status. Copper phytotoxicity symptoms do not occur when Cu was supplied chelated by EDTA. The use of synthetic agent EDTA (as Cu-EDTA and Fe-EDTA) prevented the accumulation of toxic Cu-level in plants and allowed a better homeostasis among nutrients. In presence of citrate, high concentration of Cu occurred in plants but its phytotoxicity was limited when even EDTA was available in solution. Results suggest that maize plants can operate a good control of nutritional status when Cu-excess is present concomitantly with a synthetic chelator (as EDTA) even when supplied as a Fe-fertilizer. These results pave the way to provide guidelines for the fertilization managements on Cu-contaminated soils to alleviate phytotoxicity in crops."
