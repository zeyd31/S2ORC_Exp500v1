            "text": "Perf o rmance in cognitive tests can be influenced by age and education level.In developing countries, formal education is limited for most people.Application of the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) test, in its original version could have an adverse effect on the evaluation of low educated and elderly individuals.O b j e c t i v e: To assess the cognitive perf o rmance of low and middle educated old people in a modified version of the adapted to portuguese language MMSE.M e t h o d: A study was carr i e d out enrolling 253 individuals, aged 60 to 90 years included in different schooling levels.Four educational g roups were studied: illiterate;1-4 schooling years; 5-8 schooling years and over 8 schooling years.Besides, the sample was also studied according to six classes: 60-65, 66-70, 71-75, 76-80, 81-85 and 86-90 years.The modified version (mo-MMSE) included modifications in copy and calculation items from the adapted MMSE (ad-MMSE) to Portuguese language.The maximum possible score was the same in the two versions: total, 30; copy, 1 and calculation, 5. Results: mo-MMSE scores were significantly higher than ad-MMSE for every age classes.A negative correlation was observed between age and scores in individuals of 1-4 and in individuals over eight schooling years, both in ad-MMSE and mo-MMSE.However, there was not a significant c o rrelation between age and scores in illiterate group and in individuals of 5-8 schooling years.C o n c l u s i o n: The modification of copy and calculation items of ad-MMSE, are responsible by the best perf o rmance in mo-MMSE.Cultural background could have influenced this result.Individuals with more than eight years of formal instruction are protected against a reduction of their capacity to solve cognitive tests.However, low instructed individuals have not this capacity and so they present signals of intellectual aging before they become elderly people."
