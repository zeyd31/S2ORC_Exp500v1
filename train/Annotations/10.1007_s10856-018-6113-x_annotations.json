            "text": "The surface charge of a biomaterial represents a promising tool to direct cellular behavior, which is crucial for therapeutic approaches in regenerative medicine. To expand the understanding of how the material surface charge affects protein adsorption and mesenchymal stem cell behavior, differently charged surfaces with zeta potentials spanning from −25 mV to +15 mV were fabricated by the conjugation of poly(amidoamine) to alginate-based hydrogels. We showed that the increase of the biomaterials surface charge resulted in enhanced quantities of biologically available, surface-attached proteins. Since different surface charges were equalized after protein adsorption, mesenchymal stem cells interacted rather with diverse protein compositions instead of different surface features. Besides an enhanced cell attachment to increasingly positively charged surfaces, the cell spreading area and the expression of adhesion-related genes integrin α5 and tensin 1 were found to be increased after adhesion. Moreover, first results indicate a potential impact of the surface charge on mesenchymal stem cell differentiation towards bone and fat cells. The improved understanding of surface charge-related cell behavior has significant impact on the design of biomedical devices and artificial organs.Graphical Abstract* Heiko Zimmermann"
