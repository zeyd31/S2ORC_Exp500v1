IMNCI is found to be an effective strategy for management of acute childhood respiratory illness which will be more effective in managing pneumonia when supplemented by an illness severity scoring system. In this regard use of Acute Illness Observation Score (AIOS)-an illness severity scale developed by P. L. McCarthy based on simple observation which acts as sensitive indicator of severity of illness in children. In this background the present study was undertaken to validate AIOS in predicting illness severity and clinical outcome of community acquired pneumonia. METHODOLOGY: This was a descriptive epidemiological study conducted on children in age group of 2-59months, with clinical features of pneumonia as per WHO recommendations. IMNCI and Acute Illness Observation Scale (AIOS) scoring is applied on each subject to assess the severity of community acquired pneumonia. Respiratory parameters, investigations, treatment and disease course are documented and statistical analysis was done. RESULTS: AIOS scoring has good internal consistency and external validity. AIOS correlates well with clinical signs, abnormal X ray findings, initial SpO2 reading, predicting and therapeutic decision taken by the physician and clinical outcomes. Comparing with IMNCI, sensitivity of AIOS in detecting illness severity in pneumonia group was very high but with a poor specificity, where as in very severe pneumonia its sensitivity was poor but had very high specificity. CONCLUSION: AIOS can be used as a tool to decide on therapeutic modalities and prognosticating a child with pneumonia admitted to the hospital. This study indicates the clinimetric validity of AIOS in managing childhood pneumonia and suggests its role in further enriching IMNCI strategy."
