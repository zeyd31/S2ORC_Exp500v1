            "text": "The asymmetric unit of the title compound, [Mn(NCS) 2 (C 12 H 9 NO) 4 ], consists of one Mn II cation located on a centre of inversion, one thiocyanate anion and two 4-benzoylpyridine co-ligands. The Mn II cation is octahedrally coordinated by two terminally N-bonded anionic ligands and four N-bonded 4-benzoylpyridine co-ligands within a slightly distorted octahedron. Individual complexes are linked by intermolecular C-HÁ Á ÁO hydrogen-bonding interactions into chains running along the c-axis direction. Simultaneous thermogravimetry and differential scanning calorimetry measurements reveal a decomposition in two separate steps, in each of which two co-ligands are removed. The compound obtained after the first step has the composition [Mn(NCS) 2 (C 12 H 9 NO) 2 ] and is of unknown structure, before in the second step decomposition into [Mn(NCS) 2 ] is observed. Magnetic susceptibility measurements show the Mn II cations to be in the high-spin state, and that weak antiferromagnetic interactions between the complexes are present."
