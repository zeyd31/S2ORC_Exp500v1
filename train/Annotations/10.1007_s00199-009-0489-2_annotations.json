            "text": "This paper presents a unified framework for characterizing symmetric equilibrium in simultaneous move, two-player, rank-order contests with complete information, in which each player's strategy generates direct or indirect affine \"spillover\" effects that depend on the rank-order of her decision variable. These effects arise in natural interpretations of a number of important economic environments, as well as in classic contests adapted to recent experimental and behavioral models where individuals exhibit inequality aversion or regret. We provide the closed-form solution for the symmetric Nash equilibria of this class of games, and show how it can be used to directly solve for equilibrium behavior in auctions, pricing games, tournaments, R&D races, models of litigation, and a host of other contests.We are grateful to two referees for exceptionally lucid and helpful reports.

We show that these effects arise in natural interpretations of a number of important economic environments, including contests adapted to recent experimental and behavioral models where individuals exhibit inequality aversion or regret. We provide a characterization of symmetric equilibria (both pure and mixed), closed-form expressions for these equilibria, and show how our results may be used to directly solve for equilibrium behavior in auctions, pricing games, tournaments, R&D races, models of litigation, and a host of other games.Rank-order contests are ubiquitous. These take the form of environments in which players choose non-negative bids (which may be interpreted as a proposed payment, effort, or the commitment of other scarce resources that are non-refundable) whose rank-order discontinuously influences the probability of winning some prize. Classic examples include homogeneous product Bertrand competition (see Bertrand 1883), in which the lowest price firm \"wins\" the profit from selling to demand at that price, as well as first-and second-price auctions (see Vickrey 1961), where the player who submits the highest bid wins the item and pays either his own bid (in the first-price auction) or the bid of the second-highest bidder (in the second-price auction).Winners and losers alike forfeit payments in many rank-order contests. In a firstprice all-pay auction, for instance, each player submits a non-refundable bid and only the higher bidder receives a prize. The war-of-attrition (see Maynard Smith 1974) is a second-price all-pay auction: the high bidder wins the prize and pays the amount bid by the second-highest bidder. These forms of competition have been widely used to model activities as diverse as patent and R&D races, lobbying and rent-seeking activities, litigation, advertising and political campaigns, tournaments as incentive devices in labor markets, competition for college admissions, sports competitions, urban architecture, and territorial contests among organisms. 1   The principal motivation of this article is that spillovers are often important in rank-order contests; in many economic environments, one player's decision affects the other player's payoff, and the nature of this effect may depend on the rank-order of the players' choices. This is perhaps most obvious in second-price auctions where the high bidder pays the second-highest bid, but spillovers also arise in a variety of economic contexts. For instance, an extensive literature starting with D'Aspremont and Jacquemin (1988) has examined the effects of positive spillovers in R&D competition"
