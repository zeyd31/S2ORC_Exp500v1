            "text": "Tailings are one of the primary solid wastes of mining industry. They are made of fine-grained particles of the parent rock from which the ore is extracted by crushing, grinding, and other milling processes. Furthermore, volumetrically, tailings impoundments are among the largest structures created by human kind. The safety of the tailing reservoir is one of the major concerns. The characteristics of tailings are a result of the composition of the parent rock and the method of ore processing. In this paper, the two types of tailings from an iron mine in South China were systematically investigated in terms of their mechanical characteristics including the physical features and dynamic response. The deformation of tailing reservoir in design was evaluated considering the earthquake load. This study provides a scientific basis for optimal design and safe operation of the future tailings storage facility."
