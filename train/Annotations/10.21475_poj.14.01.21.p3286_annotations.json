            "text": "The decrease in agricultural productivity in successive cutting of sugarcane plants is associated with several extrinsic and intrinsic factors. However, no studies have focused on the physiological potential of sett roots in successive cuts in sugarcane culture. There have been no proteomic studies on sugarcane sett roots at different stages of cutting. In this study, the UPLC-ESI-TOF-MS system and bioinformatics tools were used to identify proteins of sett roots in the first and fifth cuts of sugarcane cultivar RB966928 in the sprouting stage. Differences in the proteome of sett roots of RB966928 in the first and fifth cuts detected in this study supports the hypothesis that the proteome of sett roots may change after successive cuts in sugarcane culture. A reduction in the number of proteins was observed in the roots of the fifth cut, whereas 34% of proteins, identified exclusively in the first cut, were absent in the fifth cut. Proteome analysis of sett roots in the first and fifth cuts showed that the changes after successive cuts were quantitative (number of proteins) and mainly qualitative. In this study, the detailed list of proteins identified in the first cut but absent in the fifth cut is relevant. The findings of this study may aid further research that employ biotic or abiotic elicitors to induce gene expression of essential proteins absent in sett roots of the fifth cut, and thus increasing the agricultural productivity and longevity of cane fields.Keywords: Saccharum spp.; longevity; productivity; stress proteins; sett roots proteomic.
