            "text": "Introduction:In 2003, the Institute of Medicine recommended that interprofessional education be incorporated into the training programs of health care professionals. However, many logistical challenges hinder formal interprofessional learning in health care profession programs. Methods: This resource is a 3hour interprofessional small-group session designed for health professions student teams to engage in a standardized patient encounter, each team member contributing a profession-specific perspective to create a collaborative care plan across five discharge decisions. The activity includes a simulated standardized patient encounter and debrief session wherein students discuss the role of bias and communication and create a collaborative care plan. Results: Following the activity, participants were surveyed about the value of the educational experience. Over 12 months, 106 students (81 medicine, nine nursing, 16 pharmacy) participated in the interprofessional activity. Eighty-four students responded to the postevent survey (79% response rate). Students were confident that the experience helped them integrate profession-specific knowledge, create a shared care plan, and understand how interprofessional collaboration contributes to quality care. The debriefing session and interprofessional interaction were an integral component of the experience. Discussion: This resource is a feasible interprofessional smallgroup activity that has been implemented without excessive faculty time or institutional resources. It is adaptable to institutional needs, local resources, level of trainee, and professions. The session provides interprofessional students the opportunity to engage with one another and with the patient in a collaborative decision-making activity focused around a critical transition of care.Educational ObjectivesBy the end of this session, learners will be able to:1. Demonstrate effective communication with other professionals about the care of the patient, resolving conflict when necessary. 2. Compare and contrast the scope of practice for each of the professions presented. 3. Verbalize how each team member's profession-specific contribution leads to care that is safe, timely, effective, efficient, equitable, and patient centered. 4. Effectively communicate profession-specific perspectives and priorities with the interprofessional team members in developing a shared patient-centered care plan.
