            "text": "Objective Cerebral amyloid angiopathy-related inflammation (CAA-RI) is a rare and potentially treatable encephalopathy that usually affects people older than 50 years old and has an acute or subacute clinical presentation characterized by rapidly evolving cognitive decline, focal deficits and seizures. In a small subset of patients the disease can adopt a pseudotumoral form in the neuroimages that represents a very difficult diagnostic challenge. Methods Here in we report a patient with a tumour-like presentation of histopathologically confirmed CAA-RI. Results  We also conducted a search and reviewed the clinical and radiological features of 41 cases of pseudotumoral CAA-RI previously reported in the literature in order to identify those characteristics that should raise diagnostic suspicions of the disease, there by avoiding unnecessary surgical treatments. Conclusion The therapy of CAA-RI with steroids is usually effective and clinical and radiological remission can be achieved in the first month in approximately 70% of cases.Psychiatry Investig"
