            "text": "Extreme-mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) are promising target sources for space-based interferometers such as LISA, Taiji, and Tianqin. Depending on the astrophysical environment, such as close perturbers or an accretion disk, EMRI orbital evolution may deviate from the predictions of general relativity in vacuum. In particular, we focus on the resonance jumps, i.e., the changes of the conserved quantities induced by a stationary perturbation to the background Kerr geometry. Using Hamiltonian formulation, we provide a closed relation between the jump in Carter constant and that in the axial component of angular momentum. It is also shown that the obtained relation is consistent with the fitting formulae computed for the tidal resonance in previous works."
