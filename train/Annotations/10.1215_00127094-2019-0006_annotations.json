More precisely, the K-(semi,poly)-stability of cubic threefolds coincide to the corresponding GIT stabilities, which could be explicitly calculated. In particular, this implies that all smooth cubic threefolds admit KÃ¤hler-Einstein metric as well as provides a precise list of singular KE ones. To achieve this, the main new ingredient is an estimate in dimension three of the normalized volumes of kawamata log terminal singularities introduced by Chi Li."
