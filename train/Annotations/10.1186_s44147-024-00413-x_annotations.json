            "text": "Wind power prediction holds significant value for the stability of the electrical grid when wind power is connected to the grid.Using neural networks for wind power prediction may have some limitations, such as slow speed and low accuracy.This paper proposes to enhance the power prediction accuracy and speed by optimizing the neural network through health assessment wind turbines.Firstly, based on wind turbine actual operating data, a health assessment is conducted to obtain a health matrix of wind turbine.Then, by calculating the weights of the matrix, the power prediction strategy of the network is optimized.Following that, matrix approximation hyperparameters are utilized to expedite the optimization process.Finally, some tests are conducted on neural network power prediction, act as optimized back propagation (BP) neural network and whale swarm algorithm-support vector regression (WSA-SVR) neural networks are employed for wind power prediction.Results show noticeable optimization: after optimizing the BP network, power prediction accuracy increased by about 40%, and prediction speed rose by about 20%; after optimizing the WSA-SVR network, power prediction accuracy improved by 10%, and prediction speed surged by about 45%.Further analysis shows that this method can improve the accuracy and speed of most neural network wind power prediction algorithms."
