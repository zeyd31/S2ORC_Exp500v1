            "text": "Accurately predicting response properties of molecules such as the dynamic polarizability and hyperpolarizability using quantum mechanics has been a long-standing challenge with widespread applications in material and drug design. Classical simulation techniques in quantum chemistry are hampered by the exponential growth of the many-electron Hilbert space as the system size increases. Building upon the quantum linear system algorithm [Harrow et al., Phys. Rev. Lett.  103, 150502 (2009)], we describe an algorithm for computing molecular response functions in the frequency domain on quantum computers, which scales polynomially in the system size instead of the dimension of the exponentially large Hilbert space, and hence achieves an exponential speedup over existing classical algorithms."
