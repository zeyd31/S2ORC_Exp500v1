            "text": "Cancer is a complex disease that causes the alterations in the levels of gene, RNA, protein and metabolite. With the development of genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomic techniques, the characterisation of key mutations and molecular pathways responsible for tumour progression has led to the identification of a large number of potential targets. The increasing understanding of molecular carcinogenesis has begun to change paradigms in oncology from traditional single-factor strategy to multi-parameter systematic strategy. The therapeutic model of cancer has changed from adopting the general radiotherapy and chemotherapy to personalised strategy. The development of predictive, preventive and personalised medicine (PPPM) will allow prediction of response with substantially increased accuracy, stratification of particular patient groups and eventual personalisation of medicine. The PPPM will change the approach to tumour diseases from a systematic and comprehensive point of view in the future. Patients will be treated according to the specific molecular profiles that are found in the individual tumour tissue and preferentially with targeted substances, if available."
