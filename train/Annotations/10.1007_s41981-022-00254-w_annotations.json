            "text": "is to consider the importance of fast mixing to achieve a better control on the fast reaction time. In a conventional batch system, this must be questioned as the multiple substitution observed could be caused by inhomogeneous mixing. However, it should be kept in mind that complete mixing at the molecular level may not be possible at all. Due to the aggregation of the lithium alkyls 5, theoretically, there is always a local excess of organolithium reagent, even with equimolar amounts to the halosilane. The influence of the aggregation of lithium alkyls on the selectivity of the reaction has not yet been resolved.Results and DiscussionWe want to present our latest results on the selective monosubstitution of trichlorophenylsilane (1) with n-butyllithium in a microflow reactor. Flow chemistry has shown great success and advantages in the application for halogen-lithium exchanges and other reaction types. 6 However, an application for substitution reactions has so far rarely been found in the literature, although there should be a great potential in this area. Therefore, we want to explore the potential of flow chemistry for substitution reactions with highly reactive reagents in order to obtain high selectivity and conversion even under mild conditions. Flow chemistry offers a multitude of advantages such as more efficient and faster mixing, better heat dissipation and a more resource-efficient and safe reaction management.AbstractOrganolithium compounds have been used successfully in flow chemistry since the recent past. Most of the studies dealt with the use in halogen-lithium exchanges. So far, however, there has been a lack of use in substitution reactions. The use of flow microreactors makes the highly reactive organolithium compounds more controllable and thus creates new synthetic possibilities."
