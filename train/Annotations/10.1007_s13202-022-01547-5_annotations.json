            "text": "The use of nanoparticles (NPs) can considerably benefit enhanced oil recovery (EOR) by changing the wettability of the rock, improving the mobility of the oil drop, and decreasing the interfacial tension (IFT) between oil and water. Prior to the application of nanoparticles in oil fields, it is essential to conduct measurements at the laboratory scale. However, the estimation of reservoir wettability is difficult in most laboratory experiments. Practicably, ZnO NPs were used to modify the rock surface wettability, lower the IFT at the oil/water interface, and reduce the interaction of chemical adsorption, such as (surfactant) onto reservoir rock surface to solve various challenges in oil production and EOR operations. Upon confining both ZnO-based nanofluid and the crude oil into sandstone, deviations from the corresponding pure bulk dynamical behaviors were observed with low-field nuclear magnetic resonance (LF-NMR) relaxometry. The expected deviations from the pure bulk behaviors were attributed to the well-known confinement effect. The wettability test results before and after surface variations of formation water (FW) with the addition of three different NP concentrations (0.05, 0.075, and 0.1) wt% ZnO reflected significant changes to its wettability. Among the treatments of Berea sandstone cores with ZnO NPs, the percentage of clay-bound H 2 O/free fluid index was maximum in 1.0 pore volume (PV) NP treatment. The ratio of NMR relaxations, which determines the affinity of fluids toward solids, by the 1.0 PV NP treatment is reported to have the most potential with higher affinity for FW and less affinity for crude oil toward the pore walls. Hence, LF-NMR allows monitoring of nanofluid and crude oil characteristics in the pores of rock samples and may potentially be applied in further EOR studies."
