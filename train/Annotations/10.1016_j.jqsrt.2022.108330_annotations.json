            "text": "Using the polarisation labelling spectroscopy, we performed the detailed analysis of the level structure of excited electronic states of the 39 KCs molecule in the excitation energy interval between 17500 cm −1 and 18600 cm −1 above the v = 0 level of the X 1 Σ + ground state. We prove that the observed states are strongly coupled by spin-orbit interaction above 18200 cm −1 , as manifested by numerous perturbations in the recorded spectra. The spectra are interpreted with the guidance of accurate electronic structure calculations on KCs, including potential energy curves, transition electric dipole moments, and representation of the spin-orbit interaction with a quasi-diabatic effective Hamiltonian approach. The agreement between theory and experiment is found remarkable, clearly discriminating among the available theoretical data. This study confirms the accuracy of the polarisation labelling spectroscopy to analyse highly-excited electronic * Corresponding authors molecular states which present a dense level structure.The relative simplicity of such species allows many kinds of elaborate studies, like in the case of the present work, the exploration of the structure of their highly-excited electronic states. Their spectroscopic identification often becomes problematic as several electronic states could lie in the same energy range, sometimes interacting with each other, so that the assignment of the observed spectral lines could be ambiguous. Similarly, their theoretical representation involves a large configuration space, preventing them to be accurately treated with conventional numerical approaches. Therefore accurate theoretical calculations on molecular states and their couplings are needed, and may"
