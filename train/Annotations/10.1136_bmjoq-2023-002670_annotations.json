            "text": "The Sengkang General Hospital Orthopaedic Spine Outpatient Service is facing a growing challenge of increasing number of referrals and waiting times, placing a significant burden on the system.Primary care referrals have an average wait time of 61.1 days, with 34.5%f patients waiting longer than 60 days from referral to appointment, to see a spine physician.Back pain is a very common presentation, with the vast majority resolving after conservative management which commonly includes analgesia, physiotherapy and reassurance.Unfortunately, many referrals from primary care involve patients who have yet to explore the avenues of conservative management with 90% of our referrals being managed without surgery.Globally, triage services in Western countries conducted by allied health professionals have shown to be an effective method at addressing the escalating wait times with high satisfaction rates.We have endeavoured to emulate this within our department through the implementation of the Spine Triage and Rehabilitation (STAR) Clinic.The STAR clinic aims to empower physiotherapists with the ability to triage patients into surgical and non-surgical categories with their primary physiotherapy expertise to reduce waiting times and increase outpatient capacity.More than 300 patients were recruited, and their progress was tracked over 13 months under the four Ss of: waiting timeS, cost Savings, Safety and patient Satisfaction.This pilot study has been overwhelmingly positive, with significantly reduced waiting times and high cost savings, without any compromise on patient safety and satisfaction."
