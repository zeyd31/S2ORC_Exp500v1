            "text": "The article examines the graphic, spelling and morphological features characteristic for medieval texts created in Nuremberg. The study involves spiritual literature created in various Nuremberg scriptoria. Each investigated text is considered as an integral and independent graphic and spelling system, consisting of interrelated elements. Following features presented in the studied manuscripts are revealed in the course of the analysis of the texts: the Middle and Early New High German features, features characteristic of the Southeastern, East Frankish and Nuremberg dialects, as well as the spelling features. The reasons for the differences between the graphic and spelling systems of the studied texts from the phonetic system of Early New High German and intertextual differences are subject to interpretation. The analysis of the scriptoria peculiarities makes it possible to determine the place of graphic and orthographic systems in the context of Early New High German linguistic dynamics, as well as the degree of influence of various dialects on them. When considering the graphic and orthographic features of the studied texts, the specificity of the written fixation of Early New High German is taken into account as well as the fact that the urban written language and the urban dialect are different sources of influence on the formation of the written tradition of each scriptorium. This study allows to conclude about the degree of independence of the graphic and spelling systems of manuscripts and about the usability of the norms of the written language of the period under study.
