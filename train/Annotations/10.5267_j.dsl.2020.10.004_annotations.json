            "text": "Multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) methods are systematical science projects to help decision-makers reach accurate decisions. Applying MCDM methods in the military is important because accurate decision making is the deciding factor for success and can reduce expenditure and increase defense capability. The full consistency method (FUCOM), one of the methods in the MCDM group, has many advantages, and its results are reliable. This paper aims to evaluate and select an appropriate fighter aircraft for Vietnam People's Air Force. Using FUCOM as a decision-making process, we find the final weight values of criteria and apply the additive ratio assessment (ARAS) method to derive the final ranking of alternatives to comply with criteria. Sensitivity analysis is conducted and the result is compared with the weighted product method to substantiate the sturdiness of the proposed method. The results show the Su-35 as the best available solution."
