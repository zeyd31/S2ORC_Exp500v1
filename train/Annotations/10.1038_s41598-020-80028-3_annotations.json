            "text": "Aspergillus niger has the ability to produce a large variety of proteases, which are of particular importance for protein digestion, intracellular protein turnover, cell signaling, flavour development, extracellular matrix remodeling and microbial defense. However, the A. niger degradome (the full repertoire of peptidases encoded by the A. niger genome) available is not accurate and comprehensive. Herein, we have utilized annotations of A. niger proteases in AspGD, JGI, and version 12.2 MEROPS database to compile an index of at least 232 putative proteases that are distributed into the 71 families/subfamilies and 26 clans of the 6 known catalytic classes, which represents ~ 1.64% of the 14,165 putative A. niger protein content. The composition of the A. niger degradome comprises ~ 7.3% aspartic, ~ 2.2% glutamic, ~ 6.0% threonine, ~ 17.7% cysteine, ~ 31.0% serine, and ~ 35.8% metallopeptidases. One hundred and two proteases have been reassigned into the above six classes, while the active sites and/or metal-binding residues of 110 proteases were recharacterized. The probable physiological functions and active site architectures of these peptidases were also investigated. This work provides a more precise overview of the complete degradome of A. niger, which will no doubt constitute a valuable resource and starting point for further experimental studies on the biochemical characterization and physiological roles of these proteases.Proteases (also called peptidases, proteinases or proteolytic enzymes), catalyzing the cleavage of peptide bonds within proteins and polypeptides, are crucial for a variety of biological processes in organisms ranging from lower (viruses, bacteria, and fungi) to the higher organisms (mammals). Besides being essential for life, they also find wide applications in food, beverage, leather, pharmaceutical, textile and detergent industries 1,2 , and have been regarded as the most important industrial enzymes accounting for nearly 60% of the total enzyme market 3 . Proteases make up the most complex family of enzymes that possess different catalytic mechanisms with various active sites and divergent substrate specificities 4 . The MEROPS database (https ://www.ebi.ac.uk/merop s/) provides a structure-based catalogue and classification of peptidases, as well as their substrates and inhibitors 5 . Based on their catalytic sites, cleavage sites and substrate specificities, proteolytic enzymes are mainly divided into 7 classes: aspartic (A), cysteine (C), glutamic (G), metallo (M), serine (S) and threonine (T) peptidases, as well as asparagine peptide lyase (N) 5 . Protease classes are subdivided into clans according to their evolutionary relationship. Clans are further classified into families by common ancestry, while subfamilies have common structure yet unclear ancestry 6 . This classification system has facilitated the comprehensive identification and comparison of the degradomes (the complete repertoire of peptidases expressed in an organism at any particular moment or circumstance) in different organisms, especially mammals 7-13 . Recently, the Degradome database (http://degra dome.uniov i.es/), containing the curated sets of known protease genes in human, chimpanzee, mouse and rat, has been developed 14 .Aside from mammals, commercial proteases can also be produced by plants and microbes. Among them, microorganisms served as a preferred source of proteolytic enzymes for industrial applications owing to their high yield and productivity, broad catalytic and biochemical diversities, as well as susceptibility to genetic manipulation 15 . Aspergillus niger, a filamentous fungus with a long tradition of safe use in the production of various metabolites and industrial enzymes 16 , is able to grow on a wide range of substrates under various environmental conditions due to its ability to secrete large amounts of hydrolytic enzymes, including proteases 17,18 . So OPEN www.nature.com/scientificreports/ far, however, a comprehensive and precise view of the A. niger degradome is not available, and only approximately 8.2% A. niger proteases have been molecularly and biochemically characterized based on literature survey 19 .Currently, the genome sequencing of 14 A. niger strains have been completed, among which the genome sequences of A. niger strains CBS 513.88 18 and ATCC 1015 20 have been extensively studied. This has opened the opportunity to investigate the complexity of the A. niger degradome. Although approximately 307 putative peptidases and 135 non-peptidase homologues have been deposited in version 12.2 MEROPS database (https :// www.ebi.ac.uk/merop s/cgi-bin/specc ards?sp=sp000 086;type=pepti dase), many putative proteases are either not peptidases or identical to others. Additionally, as the A. niger genome is still subject to revisions, the classification, active sites and metal binding residues of these peptidases also need to be revised. In the present study, we utilized annotations of A. niger proteases in AspGD, JGI, and version 12.2 MEROPS database to identify putative proteases. MEROPS classification system (version 12.2) 5 was then employed to reassign these proteases, followed by in silico characterization of their active sites, active site architectures, and metal binding residues using various bioinformatics tools. The degradome presented here provides a global view of the arsenal of proteases harbored by A. niger, thereby facilitating in depth studies on their physiological roles, and the molecular and biochemical characterization of this important class of enzymes.ResultsWhole-genome analysis of the A. niger Degradome. Using the primary information retrieved from the genomes of two A. niger strains CBS 513.88 and ATCC 1015 20,21 , we have characterized a total of 323 protease-like genes(Supplementary Table S2), including the 198 putative proteases reported by Pel et al. 18  and 125 extra putative proteases found by homology search, which is similar to the total number of proteases identified by Budak et al. in A. niger and other Aspergillus species 17 . However, only 232 of them were provisionally identified as proteases by further manual annotation steps, which cover 1.64% of the 14,165 protein-coding genes predicted from the A. niger genome 18 . Another 91 genes were shown to be non-peptidase homologues, among which 65 genes were previously predicted as proteases by Pel et al.18. Among the 307 known and putative A. niger peptidases deposited in version 12.2 MEROPS database (https ://www.ebi.ac.uk/merop s/cgi-bin/specc ards?sp=sp000 086;type=pepti dase), only 186 putative peptidases are identified as proteases in this study, while 55 peptidases are identical to others, with other 66 proteins reclassified as non-peptidase homologues(Supplementary Table S3). Interestingly, besides the 186 putative proteases in MEROPS database, another 46 putative peptidase were identified in the present study.Among the 232 putative proteases identified here, 216 proteases had homologues in the other A. niger strain, while eleven and five proteases were only from A. niger strains CBS 513.88 and ATCC 1015, respectively, containing only one single member with no homologues in the other strain(Supplementary Table S2), and were therefore considered \"orphan genes\" 22 . As analyzed by the six subcellular location predictors, 62 out of the 232 proteases (i.e., 26.7% of the whole degradome) were found to be extracellular enzymes, which was similar to the number of extracellular proteases in A. flavus NRLL 3357 but more than those in other Aspergillus species 17 .Reclassification of the proteases identified in the two A. niger strains. Reassignment of the proteases was performed by the combination of MEROPS database (version 12.2) and manual literature searches. Finally, based on the cleavage sites and active sites, the 232 putative A. niger proteases were reassigned into 6 classes, including ~ 7.3% (17/232) aspartic, ~ 2.2% (5/232) glutamic, ~ 6.0% (14/232) threonine, ~ 17.7% (41/232) cysteine, ~ 31.0% (72/232) serine, and ~ 35.8% (83/232) metallopeptidases(Table 1,Fig. 1aand SupplementaryComputer-based comprehensive literature searches showed that a total of 19 proteases have been molecularly and/or biochemically characterized, among which there are 6 aspartic, 1 glutamic, 11 serine and 1 metallopeptidases(Supplementary Table S4). Besides, 41 proteases have been characterized by genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic or secretomic techniques.The proteases identified were also classified based on their EC numbers. As shown inFig. 1b, the 232 proteases were mainly composed of 109 exopeptidases, 111 endopeptidases, and 12 proteases with unknown EC numbers. The exopeptidases were further assigned into seven sub-subfamilies, including 17 aminopeptidases (EC 3.4.11), 16 dipeptidases (EC 3.4.13), 24 dipeptidyl-and tripeptidyl-peptidases (EC 3.4.14), 14 serine-type carboxypeptidases (EC 3.4.16), 5 metallocarboxypeptidases (EC 3.4.17) and 33 omega peptidases (EC 3.4.19), whereas endopeptidases comprise 31 serine endopeptidases (EC 3.4.21), 13 cysteine endopeptidases (EC 3.4.22), 22 aspartic endopeptidases (EC 3.4.23), 30 metalloendopeptidases (EC 3.4.24), 14 threonine endopeptidases (EC  3.4.25), and 1 endopeptidase with unknown catalytic mechanism (EC 3.4.99).As can also be seen fromFig. 1, the aspartic, glutamic and threonine peptidases identified in A. niger genome were all endopeptidases, while cysteine, serine and metallopeptidase classes contained both exo-and endopeptidases. Cysteine proteases were composed of omega peptidases and cysteine endopeptidases. Inconsistent with the previous observation that most serine peptidases are endopeptidases 6 , serine peptidases identified in A. niger were mainly exopeptidases, including aminopeptidases, dipeptidyl-and tripeptidyl-peptidases, and serine-type carboxypeptidases, with only 31 endopeptidases. Metallopeptidases were made up of 13 aminopeptidases, 16 dipeptidases, 5 metallocarboxypeptidases, 8 omega peptidases, 31 metalloendopeptidases, and 2 dipeptidyl peptidases."
