In many cases, the generating function r≥1 TCr+1(X)x r is a rational function P (x)(1−x) 2 where P (x) is a polynomial with P (1) = cat(X), that is, the asymptotic growth of TCr(X) with respect to r is cat(X). In this paper, we introduce a lower bound MTCr(X) of TCr(X) for a rational space X, and estimate the growth of MTCr(X)."
