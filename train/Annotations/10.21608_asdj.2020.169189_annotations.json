            "text": "Aim of The Study:To compare stress induced by three different denture base materials on implants retaining all on four fixed detachable dentures (Acrylic with metallic Substructure -BioHPP-all acrylic denture base material). Material and Methods: This in-vitro stress analysis (case control study) was conducted on computer generated three dimensional model simulating a completely edentulous lower arch with four implants inserted in all-on-4 implant configuration to support and retain fixed detachable prosthesis. According to the framework material of the fixed detachable prostheses. In this study, we used three models were constructed according to the framework material: Model I: Fixed detachable overdenture made from acrylic resin (poly methyl methacrylate) reinforced by casted metallic framework (cobalt chromium alloy). Model II: Fixed detachable overdenture made from high performance polymer (BIOHPP). Model III: Fixed detachable overdenture made from acrylic resin (poly methyl methacrylate). Results: Mean ± standard deviation values of the recorded microstrains at lingual aspects of the central implants when unilateral load was applied. in the loaded side, model II showed lower significant difference compared to model I and III as P-value < 0.05. For the unloaded side, the data obtained, showed that the amount of microstrains induced on the lingual aspects of the central implants for model I, II and III were, it was revealed that there was insignificant difference between all models as P-value > 0.05. Mean ± standard deviation values of the recorded microstrains at distal aspects of the peripheral implants when unilateral load was applied. Regarding the loaded side, the amount of microstrains induced on the distal aspects of the peripheral implants for model I, II and III was revealed that there was significant difference between all models as P-value < 0.05. The unloaded side, it was revealed that there was insignificant difference between all models as P-value >0.05, Conclusion: It was revealed that there was significant difference between all models in the loaded side of the central implants-as P-value < 0.05, and the amount of macrostrains induced on the lingual aspects of the central implants was the lowest in models II in comparison to model I and III. It was revealed that there was insignificant difference between all models in the unloaded side of peripheral implants as P-value > 0.05, and the amount of macrostrains induced on the distal aspects of the peripheral implants was the lowest in models II. It was revealed that there was significant difference between all models in the loaded side of peripheral implants as P-value < 0.05, and the amount of microstrains induced on the distal aspects of the peripheral implants was the lowest in models II. The Fixed detachable overdenture made from high performance polymer (BIOHPP) distributes the occlusal load well and decrease the chance of implant overloading."
