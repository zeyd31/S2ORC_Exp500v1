            "text": "LaBr 3 :Ce crystals, with photomultiplier or single SiPM readout (up to 3x3 mm 2 ) have been introduced for radiation imaging in medical physics. An R&D was pursued with 1/2\" and 1\" LaBr3:Ce crystals, from different producers, to realize compact large area detectors (up to some cm 2 area) with SiPM array readout, aiming at high light yields, good energy resolution, good detector linearity and fast time response for low-energy X-rays. The study was triggered by the FAMU experiment at the RIKEN-RAL muon facility, aiming at a precise measurement of the proton Zemach radius to solve the so-called \"proton radius puzzle\". The goal is the detection of characteristic X-rays around 130 KeV. Other applications may be foreseen for homeland security and -ray astronomy. Results were obtained with a direct readout based on a CAEN V1730 FADC, with no need for an amplification stage. At the Cs 137 peak, energy resolutions up to ∼ 3% were obtained, using a readout with Hamamatsu SiPM arrays. These results compare well with best available results obtained with a PMT readout."
