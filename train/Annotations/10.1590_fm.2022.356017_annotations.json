            "text": "Introduction: Physiotherapy in women's health emerged with the aim of promoting and maintaining physical and emotional health from the beginning to the end of pregnancy, through preventive measures against possible injuries that may occur during pregnancy, childbirth and the postpartum. Access to knowledge about obstetric physiotherapy among pregnant women is increasing, which may contribute to a search for trained professionals. Objective: To analyze the perception of pregnant women about obstetric physiotherapy. Methods: This is a qualitative study carried out at the Materno Infantil Center, in Capanema, Parana state (PR), using a semistructured interview. Content analysis used the Bardin method to categorize the thematic axes. Results: Seven pregnant women aged between 18-24 years (57%), 23-32 weeks of gestation (42%), multiparous (71%), with secondary education (42%) and income between 1-3 monthly minimum wages (86 %) were included in the study. It was found that participants' perception of physiotherapy was inaccurate, because none of the women had accessed this treatment. The women stated that physiotherapists reduce labor pain, but they have no knowledge of how these professionals work in the postpartum. Conclusion:It is concluded that it is necessary to increase information on the contribution of physiotherapists during prenatal care, delivery and postpartum."
