From December 2014 to June 2015, 128 patients were consecutively diagnosed with POF in the Department of Gynaecology and Obstetrics. The patients were randomly divided into the experimental and control groups. The experimental group received melatonin tablets (1-3 mg/day), while the control group received placebo tablets. The levels of six sex hormones, percentage of T lymphocytes in the G 1 /M phase, and levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) were determined at four different time-points (1 day before treatment, and at 1, 3 and 6 months after treatment) in both groups. After 6 months of treatment, the levels of luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone were significantly decreased in the experimental group compared with the control group (P<0.05). Compared with the control group, the levels of ROS in plasma were significantly decreased in the experimental group (P<0.05). Correlation analysis showed that the levels of melatonin in peripheral blood were negatively related with the levels of ROS (rs=-0.481, P<0.05).One-year follow-up study showed that the normal excretion of ovarian hormones in the experimental group was significantly higher than that of the control group (P<0.05). In conclusion, treatment with melatonin is an effective approach to suppress POF. The potential mechanism of melatonin is inhibition of ROS production and protection of the process of normal follicle development."
