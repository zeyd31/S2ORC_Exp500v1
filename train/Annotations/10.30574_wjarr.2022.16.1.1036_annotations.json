            "text": "In this research, the importance of energy auditing and the process of energy auditing was discussed extensively. The study covers an energy audit. The calculations cover the amount of energy consumed in the administrative complex of Benue State Polytechnic Ugbokolo and the estimation of the consumed Energy per hour, day(s), week and month were presented. Identification of areas of energy wastage and estimation of energy saving potential in the complex were identified, and all sections and units' facilities have been made by walk-through energy Audit. Also, a detailed analysis of the data collected was done by suggesting cost-effective measures for energy use efficiency. The results and other vital information generated through these activities were documented. The Energy Auditing for a day is the index of the consumption which normalizes the situation of energy crisis by providing conservation schemes. The Polytechnic administrative building needs a maximum of 20530.95kW of electricity per hour which cost a total of ₦1,113,598.728 for running all these appliances. The cost of running them for the minimum of 4 hours supply that those within B and E should enjoy per day and in a year amounted to ₦53,452,738.944. The research proclaimed an alternative source of supply in order to reduce excessive costs."
