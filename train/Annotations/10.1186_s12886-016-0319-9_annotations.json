The purpose of this study is to investigate the potential risk factors of RRD with CD in a Chinese population. Methods: All of 201 consecutive RRD with CD patients and 210 RRD without CD patients were enrolled in this casecontrol retrospective study. The clinical data from these cases were reviewed here. Patients were undergone scleral buckling or encircling or both, or pars plana vitrectomy with or without scleral buckling or encircling or both according the patients' condition. The incidence of RRD with CD in this Chinese population was measured, and the potential risk factors for the development of RRD with CD were investigated by multivariate logistic regression analysis. Results: In this population, the incidence of RRD with CD was 8.6 %. The incidence of RRD with CD was significantly higher in patients with macular hole (P < 0.05), retinal breaks located posterior to the equator (P < 0.05), and total detachment (P < 0.05). Furthermore, the incidence of RRD with CD was significantly higher in patients with longer axial length (P < 0.05) only when ages, IOP, AL and duration time was set for categorical variables. Conclusions: Hypotony, retinal breaks located posteriorly especially macular hole, longer axial length, and the whole retinal detachment might be the potential risk factors for the development of CD in RRD patients."
