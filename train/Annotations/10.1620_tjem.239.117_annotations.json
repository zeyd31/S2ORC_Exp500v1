            "text": "Airborne fine particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter equal to or smaller than 2.5 μ m is abbreviated as PM 2.5 , which is one of the main components in air pollution. Exposure to PM 2.5 is associated with increased risk of many human diseases, including chronic and allergic rhinitis, but the underlying molecular mechanism for its toxicity has not been fully elucidated. We have hypothesized that PM 2.5 may cause oxidative stress and enhance inflammatory responses in nasal epithelial cells. Accordingly, we used human RPMI 2650 cells, derived from squamous cell carcinoma of the nasal septum, as a model of nasal epithelial cells, and exposed them to PM 2.5 that was collected at Fudan University (31.3°N, 121.5°E) in Shanghai, China. PM 2.5 exposure decreased the viability of RPMI 2650 cells, suggesting that PM 2.5 may impair the barrier function of nasal epithelial cells. Moreover, PM 2.5 increased the levels of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the nuclear translocation of NF-E2-related factor-2 (Nrf2). Importantly, PM 2.5 also decreased the activities of superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione peroxidase. Pretreatment with N-Acetyl-L-cysteine (an anti-oxidant) reduced the degree of the PM 2.5 -induced oxidative stress in RPMI 2650 cells. In addition, PM 2.5 increased the production of granulocyte-macrophage colonystimulating factor, tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-13 and eotaxin (C-C motif chemokine ligand 11), each of which initiates and/or augments local inflammation. These results suggest that PM 2.5 may induce oxidative stress and inflammatory responses in human nasal epithelial cells, thereby leading to nasal inflammatory diseases. The present study provides insights into cellular injury induced by PM 2.5 ."
