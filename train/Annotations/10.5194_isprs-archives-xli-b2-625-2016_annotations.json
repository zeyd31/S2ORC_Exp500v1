            "text": "With the building models are getting increasingly complicated, the levels of collaboration across professionals attract more attention in the architecture, engineering and construction (AEC) industry.In order to adapt the change, buildingSMART developed Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) to facilitate the interoperability between software platforms.However, IFC data are currently shared in the form of text file, which is defective.In this paper, considering the object-based inheritance hierarchy of IFC and the storage features of different database management systems (DBMS), we propose a novel object-relational storage model that uses Oracle database to store IFC data.Firstly, establish the mapping rules between data types in IFC specification and Oracle database.Secondly, design the IFC database according to the relationships among IFC entities.Thirdly, parse the IFC file and extract IFC data.And lastly, store IFC data into corresponding tables in IFC database.In experiment, three different building models are selected to demonstrate the effectiveness of our storage model.The comparison of experimental statistics proves that IFC data are lossless during data exchange.1．INTRODUCTIONConstruction projects are comprehensive and multistage activities which involve design, construction, operation management, supervision and even demolition.Participants in different stages may use different professional applications to facilitate their work.Yet the seamless share of different models is a problem that has long vexed the architects.It is estimated that inefficient interoperability results in a total cost of $15.8 billion per year in US alone(Gallaher, 2004).To solve this problem, buildingSMART alliance® (formerly IAI, Industry Alliance for Interoperability), an international non-profit organization, developed IFC data model to facilitate the exchange of information among software applications used in the construction industry.IFC is a platform neutral and open file format specification.It defines an EXPRESS based entity-relationship model consisting of hundreds of entities organized into an object-based inheritance hierarchy.These entities cover information of every aspect of a building lifecycle.Examples of the entities include building elements such as IfcColumn, geometry such as IfcBoundingBox, and basic constructs such as IfcCartesianPoint."
