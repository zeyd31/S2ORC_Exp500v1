            "text": "A 21-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital because of massive intestinal bleeding. She started hemodialysis due to myeloperoxidase antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (AAV) at 18 years of age. Her ANCA titers remained stable; however, her C-reactive protein increased on 5 mg/day prednisolone before admission. Computed tomography angiography revealed a ruptured jejunal arterial aneurysm. Transcatheter arterial embolization, blood transfusion and the reinforcement of steroid therapy resolved her symptoms of AAV. Our case of a young patient with AAV and medium-sized arterial vasculitis is rare and emphasizes that the ANCA titer does not always rise, especially in patients with nonrenal vasculitis flare-ups.We herein report a young patient with massive intestinal bleeding caused by a ruptured jejunal arterial aneurysm, probably due to a flare-up of MPO-ANCA-positive MPA. Until the episode occurred, she had stably undergone chronic hemodialysis due to MPO-ANCA-associated glomerulonephritis, and her MPO-ANCA titer did not rise. Our case of a young patient with MPO-ANCA-positive MPA and medium-sized arterial vasculitis is rare. ANCA titers do not always rise in nonrenal vasculitis flare-ups, and a high index of suspicion for AAV is critical for a prompt diagnosis and management of vasculitis flare-ups.Case ReportA 21-year-old Japanese woman on chronic hemodialysis (HD) visited our emergency room with complaints of nausea, abdominal pain, massive hematochezia, and dizziness."
