The two remaining O atoms interconnect two H atoms of acetamidinium cations, forming an infinite chain. The CÁ Á ÁN separations within the H 2 NÁ Á ÁCÁ Á ÁNH 2 moieties are similar, with an average value of 1.305 (2) Å , which is in good agreement with a delocalization model.ExperimentalCrystal data 2C 2 H 7 N 2 + ÁSO 4 2À M r = 214.26 Triclinic, P1 a = 8.0961 (3) Å b = 11.1668 (4) Å c = 11.8821 (6) Å = 96.199 (4) = 105.905 (3) = 105.615 (4) V = 975.63 (8) Å 3 Z = 4 Mo K radiation = 0.33 mm À1 T = 150 K 0.44 Â 0.23 Â 0.21 mm Data collection Bruker-Nonius KappaCCD areadetector diffractometer Absorption correction: Gaussian (Coppens, 1970) T min = 0.915, T max = 0.958 20866 measured reflections 4459 independent reflections 3623 reflections with I > 2(I) R int = 0.040"
