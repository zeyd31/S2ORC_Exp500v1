            "text": "Children with autism spectrum disorders often suffer from poor school inclusion, loneliness, and poor quality of life. Suitable support options for overcoming these risks are lacking, partly because children's perspectives concerning their support needs are unknown. We need to improve the involvement of children in social research. However, involving children with autism in research is not always simple, and there is scant literature on qualitative methods for addressing challenges related to involving children with unique characteristics such as autism. Children with autism may lack mimetic expressions to reflect their feelings, and they may answer questions very briefly despite having a nuanced perspective on the issue addressed, thus leaving the researcher with few indicators to act upon. Consequently, it can be difficult for the researcher to \"read\" the child, assess ethical important moments, and adapt the methodology to the individual child. Based on a qualitative study of 22 children with autism in the capital region of Denmark, this article offers reflections on methodological and practical challenges in involving children with autism in research. Matching expectations between researcher and child, staying open to communication forms, and posing precise questions are shown to be important to have insight into the children's perspectives.Societies 2019, 9, 75 2 of 16 exposed group in society that needs research attention in order to improve their well-being and educational development[1]. Nevertheless, the perspectives of children with autism are only presented in research to a limited extent[14,15], and the studies involving children with autism do not focus on the development of methodological, practical, and ethical learning.Autism might influence the way that we as researchers should involve the child in our research for other reasons as well. For example, autism causes difficulties in social interaction, social communication, and social imagination, meaning that understanding indirect talk or hints, reading facial mimics, and imagining other people's thoughts and feelings can be difficult for individuals with autism, and communication in general, especially with strangers, can be a challenge for autistic people[16][17][18]. In qualitative research, interaction and communication are essential for gaining insight into the unique perspectives of individuals, and autism is naturally challenging in relation to participating in qualitative research.In addition, autism is often, but not always, correlated with a high risk of psychiatric comorbidity, such as depression or anxiety[19][20][21], as well as poor school and educational performance, loneliness, poor social inclusion with peers, and poor quality of life[20,21]. For these reasons, children with autism can be vulnerable and difficult to include in research. Examining the school well-being and everyday lives of children with autism is a delicate process, as the topics might be sensitive for the child. Moreover, while school well-being can be a sensitive subject for children without autism, the challenges are enhanced due to their inherent communicative difficulties as well as difficulties in \"reading the social game\", that is, imagining other children's emotions and talking about abstract concepts. Children with autism can be viewed as a unique group that requires, if not reinterpretation, then adaptation, adjustment, or customizing of the qualitative methods typically used for research purposes, which is the focus of this article.Neither autism nor childhood is considered a fixed concept; rather, they are sociocultural flexible categories[22]associated with overall understandings that are constantly being developed in line with societal approaches to health, childhood, and normality[23]. This might explain why there seem to be very few studies that link qualitative research methodology with childhood research as well as with autism research. Indeed, there is virtually no literature examining methods and practices for involving children with autism in qualitative research[6,24]. Consequently, this article set out to explain the methodological and practical knowledge gained from a qualitative study conducted with 22 school-aged children with autism, living in the capital region of Denmark. The overall purpose of this article is to encourage more research on the everyday lives and well-being of children with autism, as demanded by researchers in the field[5,14,15], by sharing methodological learnings."
