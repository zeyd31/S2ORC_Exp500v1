Villain models and complex Gaussian multiplicative chaos are two-component systems analogous to XY models and related to Gaussian free fields. Although the Lee-Yang property is known to be valid generally in the first case, we show that is not so in the second. Our proof is based on two theorems of general interest relating the Lee-Yang property to distribution tail behavior."
