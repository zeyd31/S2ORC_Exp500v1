            "text": "A b s t r a c tIntroduction: Approximately 1% of the world population has now been infected by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes coronavirus disease 2019 . With cases still rising and vaccines just beginning to rollout, we are still several months away from seeing reductions in daily case numbers, hospitalisations, and mortality. Therefore, there is a still an urgent need to control the disease spread by repurposing existing therapeutics. Owing to antiviral, anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, and cardioprotective actions, statin therapy has been considered as a plausible approach to improve COVID-19 outcomes. Material and methods: We carried out a meta-analysis to investigate the effect of statins on 3 COVID-19 outcomes: intensive care unit (ICU) admission, tracheal intubation, and death. We systematically searched the PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and ProQuest databases using keywords related to our aims up to November 2, 2020. All published observational studies and randomised clinical trials on COVID-19 and statins were retrieved. Statistical analysis with random effects modelling was performed using STATA16 software. Results: The final selected studies (n = 24 studies; 32,715 patients) showed significant reductions in ICU admission (OR = 0.78, 95% CI: 0.58-1.06; n = 10; I 2 = 58.5%) and death (OR = 0.70, 95% CI: 0.55-0.88; n = 21; I 2 = 82.5%) outcomes, with no significant effect on tracheal intubation (OR = 0.79; 95% CI: 0.57-1.11; n = 7; I 2 = 89.0%). Furthermore, subgroup analysis suggested 580Arch Med Sci 3, April / 2021 that death was reduced further by in-hospital application of stains (OR = 0.40, 95% CI: 0.22-0.73, n = 3; I 2 = 82.5%), compared with pre-hospital use (OR = 0.77, 95% CI: 0.60-0.98, n = 18; I 2 = 81.8%).Conclusions: These findings call attention to the need for systematic clinical studies to assess both pre-and in-hospital use of statins as a potential means of reducing COVID-19 disease severity, particularly in terms of reduction of ICU admission and total mortality reduction."
