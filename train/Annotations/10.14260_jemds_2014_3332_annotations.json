            "text": "Foramen ovale connects the middle cranial fossa to the infratemporal fossa. It is traversed by the mandibular nerve, accessory meningeal artery and lesser petrosal nerve and emissary vein which connects the cavernous venous sinus to the pterygoid venous plexus in the infratemporal fossa. Duplication of the Foramen ovale is a rare phenomenon. It is seen in both sexes and presents at various ages. Racal difference has also been reported. The presence of duplication of Foramen ovale was studied in 100 adult human skulls, collected from the department of Anatomy & Forensic medicine. It includes 30 skulls aged below 40 years of age and 70 skulls aged above 40 years. Duplication of foramen ovale was found in 3 skulls. All were unilateral (2 left and 1 Right). Knowledge regarding duplication of foramen ovale is useful during surgical exploration of the same especially during trigeminal neuralgia. Also the knowledge is useful in radio diagnosis of such conditions. The case may be mis -interpreted as any bony deformations."
