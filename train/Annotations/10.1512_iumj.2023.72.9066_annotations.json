            "text": "We show the existence of overtwisted contact structures on the (round) 3-sphere and the (flat) 3-torus for which the ambient metric is weakly compatible. Our proofs are based on the construction of S 1 -invariant nonvanishing curl eigenfields on S 3 and T 3 using suitable families of Jacobi polynomials and eigenfunctions of the Laplacian with contractible nodal sets, respectively. As a consequence, we show that the contact sphere theorem of Etnyre, Komendarczyk and Massot (2012) does not hold for weakly compatible metrics as it was suggested. Using ideas from the theory of harmonic maps, we also provide an alternative proof of a theorem of Gluck and Gu (2001) on the geometric rigidity of tight contact structures on the 3-sphere, i.e., any contact form in S 3 admitting a compatible metric that is the round one is isometric, up to a constant factor, to the standard (tight) contact form."
