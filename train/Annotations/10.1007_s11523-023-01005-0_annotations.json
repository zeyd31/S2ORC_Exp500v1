            "text": "Background Cell-cycle regulators are mutated in approximately 40% of all cancer types and have already been linked to worse outcomes in non-small cell lung cancer adenocarcinomas treated with osimertinib.However, their exact role in osimertinib resistance has not been elucidated.Objective In this study, we aimed to evaluate how the CDK4/6-Rb axis may affect the sensitivity to osimertinib.Methods We genetically increased the level of CCND1 (Cyclin D1) and reduced the levels of CDKN2A (p16) in two different adenocarcinoma cell lines, PC9 and HCC827.We also retrospectively evaluated the outcome of patients with epidermal growth factor receptor-mutated advanced non-small cell lung cancer depending on their level of Cyclin D1 and p16.Results The modified clones showed higher proliferative capacity, modifications in cell-cycle phases, and higher migratory capacity than the parental cells.Cyclin D1-overexpressing clones were highly resistant to acute osimertinib treatment.CDKN2A knockdown conferred intrinsic resistance as well, although a longer time was required for adaption to the drug.In both cases, the resistant phenotype was epidermal growth factor receptor independent and associated with a higher level of Rb phosphorylation, which was unaffected by osimertinib treatment.Blocking the phosphorylation of Rb using abemaciclib, a CDK4/6 inhibitor, exerted an additive effect with osimertinib, increasing sensitivity to this drug and reverting the intrinsic resistant phenotype.In a group of 32 patients with epidermal growth factor receptor-mutated advanced non-small cell lung cancer, assessed for Cyclin D1 and p16 expression, we found that the p16-deleted group presented a lower overall response rate compared with the control group.Conclusions We conclude that perturbation in cell-cycle regulators leads to intrinsic osimertinib resistance and worse patient outcomes."
