            "text": "The varying speed of light (VSL) has been used in cosmological models in which the physical constants vary over time. On the other hand, the Dvali, Gabadadze and Porrati (DGP) brane world model, especially its normal branch has been extensively discussed to justify the current cosmic acceleration. In this article we show that the normal branch of DGP in VSL cosmology leads to a self-accelerating behavior and therefore can interpret cosmic acceleration. Applying statefinder diagnostics demonstrate that our result slightly deviates Î›CDM model."
