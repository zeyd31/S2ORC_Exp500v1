            "text": "Direction relations between extended spatial objects are important commonsense knowledge. Recently, Goyal and Egenhofer proposed a formal model, known as Cardinal Direction Calculus (CDC), for representing direction relations between connected plane regions. CDC is perhaps the most expressive qualitative calculus for directional information, and has attracted increasing interest from areas such as artificial intelligence, geographical information science, and image retrieval. Given a network of CDC constraints, the consistency problem is deciding if the network is realizable by connected regions in the real plane. This paper provides a cubic algorithm for checking consistency of basic CDC constraint networks, and proves that reasoning with CDC is in general an NP-Complete problem. For a consistent network of basic CDC constraints, our algorithm also returns a 'canonical ' solution in cubic time. This cubic algorithm is also adapted to cope with cardinal directions between possibly disconnected regions, in which case currently the best algorithm is of time complexity O(n 5 ). * This paper is an extended version of Xiaotong Zhang, Weiming Liu, Sanjiang Li, Mingsheng Ying: Reasoning with Cardinal Directions: An Efficient Algorithm. AAAI 2008: 387-392.(GISs), robotics, computer vision, image retrieval, natural language processing, etc. While the numerical quantitative approach prevails in robotics and computer vision, it is widely acknowledged in AI and GIS that the qualitative approach is more attractive (see e.g.[4]).A predominant part of spatial information is represented by relations between spatial objects. In general, spatial relations are classified into three categories: topological, directional, and metric (e.g. size, distance, shape, etc.). The RCC8 constraint language [26] is the principal topological formalism in AI, and has been extensively investigated by many researchers (see e.g.[29,27,34,5,37,36,18,19,17]. When restricted to simple plane regions, RCC8 is equivalent to the 9-Intersection Model (9IM) [6], which is a very influential relation model in GIS.Unlike topological relations, there are several competitive formal models for direction relations[7,8,2]. Most of these models approximate a spatial object by a point (e.g. its centroid) or a box. This is too crude in real-world applications such as describing directional information between two countries, say, Portugal and Spain. Recently, Goyal and Egenhofer [11, 10] proposed a relation model, known as cardinal direction calculus (CDC), for representing direction relations between connected plane regions. In CDC the reference object is approximated by a box, while the primary object is unaltered. This means, the exact geometry of the primary object could be used in the representation of the direction. This calculus has 218 basic relations, which is quite large when compared with RCC8 and Allen's Interval Algebra[1]. Due to its expressiveness, CDC has attracted increasing interest from areas such as AI[32,33,23], GIS [12], database [31], and image retrieval[14].One basic criterion for evaluating a formal spatial relation model is the proper balance between its representation expressivity and reasoning complexity. While reasoning complexity of the point-based and the box-based model of direction relations have been investigated in depth (see[20]and [2]), there are few works discussing the complexity of reasoning with CDC.One central reasoning problem with CDC (and any other qualitative calculus) is the consistency (or satisfaction) problem. Other reasoning problems such as deriving new knowledge from the given information, updating the given knowledge, or finding a minimal representation can be easily transformed into the consistency problem[4]. In particular, given a network of CDC constraintsover n spatial variables v 1 , · · · , v n , the consistency problem is deciding if the network N is realizable by a set of n connected regions in the real plane. The consistency problem over CDC is an open problem. Before this work, we do not know if there are efficient algorithms deciding if a set of CDC constraints are realizable. Even worse, we do not know if this is a decidable problem. Furthermore, given a satisfiable set of CDC constraints, how to construct a realization in the real plane? This paper is devoted to solving these problems. We first show by examples that local consistency in particular path-consistency is insufficient for deciding"
