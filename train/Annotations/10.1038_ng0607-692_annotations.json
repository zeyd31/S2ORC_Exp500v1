            "text": "except the group of university students (P = 0.028), were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (by a Markov chain method in GENEPOP). Furthermore, we compared the genotypes among individuals with SARS with different prognoses. If L-SIGN homozygosity is a protective factor against infection, it may also be associated with better prognosis after acquiring the infection. Therefore, we also examined whether homozygotes had a better prognosis by classifying individuals with SARS who had an uneventful recovery versus those who had severe disease and were admitted to the intensive care unit for mechanical ventilation support (an approach similar to that reported previously 5 ). However, we did not detect any significant association (P = 0.9, Supplementary Table 1 online).Sample size is the main limitation of both studies. However, these two samples already represent the few 'large' collections of individuals with SARS available for genetic study. To estimate the size of an overall effect, we performed a meta-analysis of the two data sets together by the Mantel-Haenszel test using control groups in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (two groups of controls in this study and random controls from Chan et al.; total n = 1,468; 462 affected individuals and 1,006 controls). The combined odds ratio was not significant (combined OR = 0.84; 95% confidence interval: 0.66-1.06, P = 0.14).The difference in the results between the two studies was basically accounted for by a difference in the homozygote proportions in the controls (45.4% in this study versus 55.0% in Chan et al.), while the homozygote proportions among individuals with SARS are almost identical (46.9% here versus 46.3% in Chan et al.). The reason for the discrepancy in the homozygote proportions in the 'control' groups is not clear. However, a subpopulation difference in allelic and genotypic frequencies exists between northern and southern Chinese. The seven-repeat allele was more prevalent in the Beijing sample (0.7 in Beijing versus 0.64 in Hong Kong; P = 0.05), which also largely accounted for the higher proportion of homozygotes (55.7% in Beijing versus 46.0% in Hong Kong; P = 0.02). Unrecognized subpopulation structure may confound genetic association studies. Results in the study by Chan et al. suggested that this confounding factor might be present. There were three groups of controls, including two groups of hospital controls (health care workers who worked in SARS wards and affected individuals attending various outpatient clinics) and a group of blood donor controls. Interestingly, genotype distributions from both groups of hospitalbased controls deviated significantly (P < 0.0001) or marginally (P = 0.05) from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.In addition, other yet-unknown mechanisms (such as alternative splicing of the neck region, which could interfere with formation of homotetramers among homozygotes) may account for the discrepancy between the two studies. Replication is an important approach to verify any significant genetic association findings 6,7 , and additional association studies are required to establish the putative protective effect of L-SIGN homozygosity against SARS or other infections."
