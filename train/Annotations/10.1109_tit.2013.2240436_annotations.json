            "text": "We consider the recovery of sparse signals subject to sparse interference, as introduced in Studer et al., IEEE Trans. IT, 2012. We present novel probabilistic recovery guarantees for this framework, covering varying degrees of knowledge of the signal and interference support, which are relevant for a large number of practical applications. Our results assume that the sparsifying dictionaries are characterized by coherence parameters and we require randomness only in the signal and/or interference. The obtained recovery guarantees show that one can recover sparsely corrupted signals with overwhelming probability, even if the sparsity of both the signal and interference scale (near) linearly with the number of measurements.• The interference support set E is arbitrary, i.e., E ⊆ {1, . . . , n b } can be any subset of cardinality n e . In particular, E may depend upon the sparse signal vector x and/or the dictionary A, and hence, may also be chosen adversarially. The support set X of x is chosen uniformly at random, i.e., X is chosen uniformly at random from all subsets of {1, . . . , n a } with cardinality n x .• The support set E of the sparse interference vector e is chosen uniformly at random, i.e., E is chosen uniformly at random from all subsets of {1, . . . , n b } with cardinality n e . The support set X is assumed to be arbitrary and of size n x .• Both X and E, the support sets of the signal and of the interference with size n x and n e , respectively, are chosen uniformly at random.In addition, for each model on the support sets X and E we may or may not know either of the support sets prior to recovery.As discussed in [2], recovery of the sparse signal vector x from the sparsely corrupted observation z in(1)is relevant in a large number of practical applications. In particular, restoration of saturated or clipped signals [3]-[5], signals impaired by impulse noise [6]-[8], or removal of narrowband interference is captured by the input-output relation (1). Furthermore, the model (1) enables us to investigate sparsity-based super-resolution and in-painting [9], [10], as well as signal separation [11], [12]. Hence, identifying the fundamental limits on the recovery of the vector x from the sparsely corrupted observation z is of significant practical interest. Recovery guarantees for sparsely corrupted signals have been partially studied in [2], [3], [13]-[20]. In particular, [2], [13] investigated coherence-based recovery guarantees for arbitrary support sets X and E and for varying levels of support-set knowledge; [14] analyzed the special DRAFT"
