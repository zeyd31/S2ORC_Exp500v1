Scanning electron microscope (SEM) images and size distributions of NPs. (a) PSt NPs (b) OTN-PSt NPs. (c) OTN-PSt-PEG NPs. All samples were synthesized by styrene and acrylic acid monomer ratio of 72:28 (mol%) and measured by SEM (SU8020; Hitachi Co., Japan) operated at an accelerating voltage of 5 kV after ion sputtering (E-1045; Hitachi Co., Japan) at 10 mA. (d) Hydrodynamic diameter of the OTN-PSt NPs with different mixture ratio of styrene and acrylic acid monomers. The diameters were determined by dynamic light scattering as shown in Materials and Methods. The diameters of the size distribution peak of each sample were also shown inTable 1.Electronic Supplementary Material (ESI) for RSC Advances. This journal is"
