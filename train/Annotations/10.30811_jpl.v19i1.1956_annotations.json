            "text": "As well known, nonlinear vibration isolation models may offer potential effectiveness for isolating low frequency vibrations. Therefore, this paper will introduce a nonlinear vibration isolation model, featuring asymmetrical and quasi-zero stiffness characteristics. Firstly, the physical model of the nonlinear vibration oscillation is shown, including a semicircular cam-roller and wedge-roller mechanism, in which cylinder adding auxiliary tank is worked as an elastic element. Secondly, its dynamic stiffness is built and numerically simulated. Based on these, the parameters which effect on dynamic stiffness of the system are identified. The analysis results confirmed that the proposed model can attain the quasi-zero stiffness by adjusting the pressure inside the cylinder of the stiffness corrected stiffness. Moreover, increasing the auxiliary tank volume will decrease the asymmetry of the stiffness curve. This study will furnish a useful insight to analyze and design a quasi-zero stiffness vibration isolator."
