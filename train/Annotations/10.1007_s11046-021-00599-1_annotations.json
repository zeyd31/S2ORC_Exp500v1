            "text": "Invasive fungal infections in liver transplant recipients are associated with elevated morbidity and mortality and pose a challenge to the treating physicians. Despite of lacking clinical data, the use of antifungal combination therapy is often considered to improve response rates in an immunocompromised patient population. We herein report a case of refractory invasive candidiasis in a liver transplant recipient treated successfully with a combination of isavuconazole und high-dose liposomal amphotericin B. The antimycotic combination treatment was able to clear a bloodstream infection with C. glabrata and led to regression of bilomas among tolerable side effects. The use of the above-mentioned antifungal combination therapy in a liver transplant recipient has not been reported previously. This case highlights the efficacy and safety of antifungal combination therapy in immunocompromised patients with refractory invasive candidiasis."
