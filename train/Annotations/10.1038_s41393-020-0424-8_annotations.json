We present a project to create and validate a new tool, the Monitoring Efficacy of NBD Treatment On Response (MENTOR), and to determine its level of concordance with decisions made by experienced clinicians in the field. Setting UK, Denmark, USA, Italy, The Netherlands, Germany. Methods The first phase was creation of the tool through a modified Delphi process. The second phase was the validation, wherein individuals with spinal cord injury with NBD were asked to complete the MENTOR tool immediately prior to clinic consultation. From the responses to the questionnaire of the tool, each participant was allocated into one of three categories reflecting the possible therapeutic recommendations (\"recommend change\", \"further discussion\" and \"monitoring\"). An expert clinician then assessed the participant, blinded to MENTOR results, and made an independent treatment decision. Results A total of 248 MENTOR forms were completed. Strong agreement was found when the MENTOR tool recommended monitoring (92%) or treatment change (83%); the lowest concordance when the decision was for the \"further discussion\" option (59%). Patient acceptability was reported by 97% of individuals. Conclusions MENTOR is an easy to use tool to monitor the treatment of NBD and determinate progression through the clinical pathway. This validation study shows good correspondence between expert clinician opinion and MENTOR result. The tool has potential to be used in other patient groups, following further studies."
