            "text": "Background: Heart failure has become a global health problem with increasing incidences worldwide. Traditional pharmacological treatments can delay but cannot reverse the underlying disease processes. The clinical application of myocardial tissue engineering represents a promising strategy because it features cell-based replacement therapies that replace partially or fully damaged cardiac tissues with in vitro-generated tissue equivalents. However, the effectiveness of this therapy is limited by poor viability and differentiation of the grafted cells. This limitation could be overcome by rapidly increasing the numbers of functional cardiomyocytes. In this study, we aimed to obtain functional myocardial tissue engineering seed cells with high proliferation and differentiation rates by combining 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethan-olamine-polyethylene glycol (DMPE-PEG) and recombinant transforming growth factor-β1 receptor I (rTGF-β1 RI), followed by binding to human adipose-derived stromal cells (hADSCs).Methods: To induce higher expression level of TGF-β1 RI, DMPE-PEG was inoculated with rTGF-β1 RI to modify the surface of hADSCs. The differentiation ability and morphological characteristics of the modified hADSCs were examined in vitro and in vivo.Results:The caridiomyocartic differentiation ability of TGF-β1 RI-modified hADSCs was significantly enhanced, as indicated by elevated expression levels of the cardiac markers cardiac troponin T (cTnT) and α-smooth muscle actin (SMA) via increased phosphorylation of the Smad signaling pathway-related proteins.Conclusion: Our findings provide new insights into stem cell transplantation therapy in myocardial tissue engineering."
