            "text": "Electrospinning is a promising technique for preparing bioartificial blood vessels. Nanofibers prepared by electrospinning can simulate the structure of extracellular matrix to promote cell adhesion and proliferation. However, thorn-like protrusions can appear as defects on electrospun scaffolds and coaxial electrospun nanofibers often have no clear core/shell structure, which can seriously affect the quality of bioartificial blood vessels. To address these problems, Tween 80 is added to the electrospinning solution, which results in a stable Taylor cone, eliminates the thorn-like protrusions on electrospun bioartificial blood vessels, and reduces interfacial effects due to different core/shell solutions during coaxial electrospinning. Simulations, biomechanical tests, and in vivo studies were performed. The results demonstrate the excellent mechanical properties and biocompatibility of the bioartificial blood vessel. This research provides a useful reference for optimizing the electrospinning process for fabricating bioartificial blood vessels.Graphical Abstract* Chuang Wu"
