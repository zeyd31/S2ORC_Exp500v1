            "text": "21Background: The influence of farming on plant, animal and microbial biodiversity has been carefully 22 studied and much debated. Here, we compare an isolate-based study of 196 Rhizobium strains to 23 amplicon-based MAUI-seq analysis of rhizobia from 17,000 white clover root nodules. We use these 24 data to investigate the influence of soil properties, geographic distance, and field management on 25Rhizobium nodule populations. 26 27 Results: Overall, there was good agreement between the two approaches and the precise allele 28 frequency estimates from the large-scale MAUI-seq amplicon data allowed detailed comparisons of 29 rhizobium populations between individual plots and fields. A few specific chromosomal core-gene 30 alleles were significantly correlated with soil clay content, and core-gene allele profiles became 31 increasingly distinct with geographic distance. Field management was associated with striking 32 differences in Rhizobium diversity, where organic fields showed significantly higher diversity levels than 33 conventionally managed trials. 34 35Conclusions:Our results indicate that MAUI-seq is suitable and robust for assessing nodule Rhizobium 36 diversity. We further observe possible profound effects of field management on microbial diversity, 37 which could impact plant health and productivity and warrant further investigation. 38"
