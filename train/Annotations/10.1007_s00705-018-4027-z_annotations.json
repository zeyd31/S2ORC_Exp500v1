            "text": "An orthotospovirus distinct from all other orthotospoviruses was isolated from naturally infected alstroemeria plants. Disease symptoms caused by this virus mainly consisted of yellow spots on the leaves based on which the name alstroemeria yellow spot virus (AYSV) was coined. A host range analysis was performed and a polyclonal antiserum was produced against purified AYSV ribonucleoproteins which only reacted with the homologous antigen and not with any other (established or tentative) orthotospovirus from a selection of American and Asian species. Upon thrips transmission assays the virus was successfully transmitted by a population of Thrips tabaci. The entire nucleotide sequence of the M and S RNA segments was elucidated by a conventional cloning and sequencing strategy, and contained 4797 respectively 2734 nucleotides (nt). Simultaneously, a next generation sequencing (NGS) approach (RNAseq) was employed and generated contigs covering the entire viral tripartite RNA genome. In addition to the M and S RNA nucleotide sequences, the L RNA (8865 nt) was obtained. The nucleocapsid (N) gene encoded by the S RNA of this virus consisted of 819 nucleotides with a deduced N protein of 272 amino acids and by comparative sequence alignments to other established orthotospovirus species showed highest homology (69.5% identity) to the N protein of polygonum ringspot virus. The data altogether support the proposal of AYSV as a new orthotospovirus species within a growing clade of orthotospoviruses that seem to share the Middle East basin as a region of origin."
