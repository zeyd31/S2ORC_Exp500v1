It is not known if, as a result, daytime sleeping in the form of naps increases. We sought to assess sleep patterns -with focus on daytime sleeping -and alertness in a Latin American crew overwintering in Argentine Antarctic station Belgrano II. Measurements were collected in 13 males during March, May, July, September and November, and included actigraphy and psychomotor vigilance tasks. Sleep duration significantly decreased during winter. A total of eight participants took at least one weekly nap across all measurement points. During winter, the nap onset was delayed, its duration increased and its efficiency improved. We observed a significant effect of seasonality in the association of evening alertness with sleep onset. Our results replicate previous findings regarding sleep during overwintering in Antarctica, adding the description of the role of napping and the report of a possible modulatory effect of seasonality in the relation between sleep and alertness. Napping should be considered as an important factor in the scheduling of activities of multicultural crews that participate in Antarctica.Light of sufficient intensity and adequate spectral composition is one of the main factors that maintain the 24-hour period of human circadian rhythms. Therefore, sleep as a bio-behavioral state is heavily shaped by our biology and by environmental factors. In high latitudes such as the ones found in Antarctica, personnel are exposed to extreme photoperiods. Probably one of the greatest concerns during Antarctic isolation is sleep disruption. A frequent observation is a sleep onset and a circadian temperature rhythm phase delay during winter, or even completely desynchronized or free-running patterns. A delay of circadian rhythm superimposed on the normal working hours implies that sleep is attempted at a suboptimal phase. During the winter, there are also decreases in efficiency, latency, duration and quality of sleep 1,2 .Sleep is a major determinant of alertness, but there are few reports about changes in performance during Antarctic missions. For example, one study showed performance decrements during a four-month summer expedition 3 . In a study that used a computerized simulation of a complex life support system, no signs of serious performance decrements were observed, but subtle indications of hidden decays appeared 4 . A recent study at Halley Station evaluated the effect of light pulses of one hour for periods of two weeks, and their intervention resulted in a circadian phase advance and improved objective cognitive performance with no changes in subjective alertness 5 ."
