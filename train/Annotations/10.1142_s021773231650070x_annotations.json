            "text": "In this paper, we investigate the electron Landau-level stability and its influence on the electron Fermi energy, E F (e), in the circumstance of magnetars, which are powered by magnetic field energy. In a magnetar, the Landau levels of degenerate and relativistic electrons are strongly quantized. A new quantity gn, the electron Landau-level stability coefficient is introduced. According to the requirement that gn decreases with increasing the magnetic field intensity B, the magnetic-field index β in the expression of E F (e) must be positive. By introducing the Dirac−δ function, we deduce a general formulae for the Fermi energy of degenerate and relativistic electrons, and obtain a particular solution to E F (e) in a superhigh magnetic field (SMF). This solution has a low magnetic-field index of β = 1/6, compared with the previous one, and works when ρ ≥ 10 7 g cm −3 and Bcr ≪ B ≤ 10 17 Gauss. By modifying the phase space of relativistic electrons, a SMF can enhance the electron number density ne, and decrease the maximum of electron 2 Authors' Names Landau level number, which results in a redistribution of electrons. According to Pauli exclusion principle, the degenerate electrons will fill quantum states from the lowest Landau level to the highest Landau level. As B increases, more and more electrons will occupy higher Landau levels, though gn decreases with the Landau level number n. The enhanced ne in a SMF means an increase in the electron Fermi energy and an increase in the electron degeneracy pressure. The results are expected to facilitate the study of the weak-interaction processes inside neutron stars and the magnetic-thermal evolution mechanism for megnetars."
