            "text": "We show that two properly embedded self-shrinkers in Euclidean space that are sufficiently separated at infinity must intersect at a finite point. The proof is based on a localized version of the Reilly formula applied to a suitable f -harmonic function with controlled gradient. In the immersed case, a new direct proof of the generalized half-space property is also presented.1.Basic notation and purpose of the paper 1.1. Weighted manifolds. By a weighted manifold (also called manifold with density, or smooth metric measure space) we mean a triadRiemannian manifold with volume element dv, dv f = e −f dv and f : M → R is a smooth weight function. The (obviously intrisic) geometric analysis of M f is related to bounds on its Bakry-Émery Ricci curvature Ric f := Ric + Hess(f ) combined with the analysis of its weighted Laplacianwhere the weighted divergence is the operator div f X = e f div(e −f X).An important example of weighted manifold is represented by the Gaussian spaceSince the weight function is f (x) = 1 2 |x| 2 we have that the Bakry-Émery Ricci curvature ishence R m+1 f is called a shrinking Ricci soliton. Moreover, the weighted Laplacian is the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck operator ∆ f u = ∆u − ∇u, x ."
