            "text": "Transient receptor potential (TRP) channels are known as temperature receptors. Each channel has an activation temperature in vitro within the physiological temperature range. Mice deficient in specific TRP channels show abnormal thermal behaviors. However, the role of TRP channels in mouse thermal behavior is not fully understood. We measured thermal behavior using a new type of thermal gradient system, where mice can freely move around the ring floor, thereby avoiding the stereotypical habit that mice have of staying in a corner, as occurs in a rectangular system. With this system, we can also analyze various factors, such as \"Spent time, \" \"Travel distance, \" \"Moving speed, \" and \"Acceleration, \" to provide more accurate information about mouse behaviors. Further analysis using this system would lead to a better understanding of the molecular basis of thermal behaviors in mice, which could help us develop ways of making humans comfortable in different temperature conditions."
