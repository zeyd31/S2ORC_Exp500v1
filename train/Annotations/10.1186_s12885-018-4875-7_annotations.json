            "text": "Background:We developed a novel plasma amino acid profile-based index (API) to detect ovarian, uterine, cervical, and endometrial cancers. In this study, we aimed to evaluate whether abnormal API values could be normalized after curative treatment in patients with gynecological malignant tumors. Methods: Patients with gynecological cancer with abnormal API values were included in this study. Pre-operative absolute API values were compared with those after curative treatment. The normalization rates of API values in patients negative for the expression of three well-known tumor markers (SCC, CA125, and CA19-9) were also evaluated. In addition, related amino acid profiles in healthy controls and patients under pre-and post-treatment conditions were analyzed. Results: Among 94 patients with abnormal pre-operative API values, the median API value was decreased from 9. 52 to 2.17 after treatment (normalization rate: 88.3%). The decreased ranges were similar in patients with adenocarcinoma (6.28; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 5.43-6.95) and squamous carcinoma (7.44; 95% CI: 3.04-8.46). In 93.5% (43/46) of patients negative for tumor markers prior to operation, API values were normalized after the successful treatment. In addition, some pre-operative abnormal amino acid profiles, including Ile, Trp, and His, were reversibly normalized after treatment. Conclusion: The API is a promising tumor marker in gynecological malignancies for the diagnosis of remission, particularly in patients negative for general tumor markers. Further studies are needed to explore the mechanisms related to the normalization of abnormal amino acid profiles."
