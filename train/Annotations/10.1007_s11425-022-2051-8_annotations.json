The new inquality fits nicely with other known inequalities due to Kojima and McShane, and due to Lê.The new quantity to be considered is the square sum of the logarithmic radii of the homological eigenvalues (with multiplicity) outside the complex unit circle, called the homological Jensen square sum. The main theorem is as follows. For any cofinal sequence of regular finite covers of a given surface, together with lifts of a given pseudo-Anosov, the homological Jensen square sum of the lifts grows at most linearly fast compared to the covering degree, and the square root of the growth rate is at most 1/ √ 4π times the Weil-Petersson translation length of the given pseudo-Anosov."
