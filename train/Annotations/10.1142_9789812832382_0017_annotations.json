            "text": "We present a rigorous proof of the appearance of quantized vortices in dilute trapped Bose gases with repulsive two-body interactions subject to rotation, which was obtained recently in joint work with Elliott Lieb [1]. Starting from the many-body Schr√∂dinger equation, we show that the ground state of such gases is, in a suitable limit, well described by the nonlinear Gross-Pitaevskii equation. In the case of axially symmetric traps, our results show that the appearance of quantized vortices causes spontaneous symmetry breaking in the ground state."
