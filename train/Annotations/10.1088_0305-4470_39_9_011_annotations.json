            "text": "We show that it is possible to transfer two-bit information via encoding a single qubit in a conventional nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiment with two very weakly polarized nuclear spins. Nevertheless, the experiment can not be regarded as a demonstration of superdense coding by means of NMR because it is based on the large number of molecules being involved in the ensemble state rather than the entanglement of the NMR states. Following the discussions, an entanglement witness, particularly applicable for NMR, is introduced based on separate and simultaneous measurement of the individual nuclear spin magnetizations."
