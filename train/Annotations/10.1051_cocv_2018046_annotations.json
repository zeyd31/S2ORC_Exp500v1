            "text": "We rigorously derive a Kirchhoff plate theory, via Γ-convergence, from a three-dimensional model that describes the finite elasticity of a thin heterogeneous sheet. The heterogeneity in the elastic properties of the material results in a spontaneous strain that depends on both the thickness variable and on the planar variable x . At the same time, the spontaneous strain is h-close to the identity, where h is the small parameter quantifying the thickness. The 2D limiting model is constrained to the set of isometric immersions of the mid-plane of the plate into R 3 , with the corresponding energy penalizing deviations of the curvature tensor associated with a deformation from a x -dependent target curvature tensor. A discussion on the 2D minimizers is provided in the case where the target curvature tensor is piecewise constant. Finally, we apply our plate theory to the modeling of swelling-induced shape changes in heterogeneous thin gel sheets."
