            "text": "The concept of single health is currently undoubtedly one of the most relevant in pandemic times, where humans and animals are together in the same world. Penicillin was discovered in the last century by Alexander Fleming, used against infectious agents mainly of bacterial types, such as Staphylococcus aureus, Corynebacterium, Streptococcus, Brucella and Mycobacterium are examples of cattle pathogens. The bacteria have developed defense mechanisms allowing them to survive in the host cell (mutation) even in the presence of antimicrobials (bacterial selection). The aim of the study was to examine the degree of knowledge of antibiotics through a structured survey of ten questions, addressed to eighty-six students from the Bachelor of Veterinary Medicine and Zootechnics in 2019. Based on the information collected and after analyzing their answers, 63.14% of the students work in Clinics and Universities, 89.47% recognize the need for a quantified prescription, 47.36% mentioned that the Veterinary Medicine can prescribe antimicrobials, 52.63% support the use of antimicrobials for all microorganisms including viruses, 52.63% use the labeling to consult the withdrawal time and 100% identify that it is the withdrawal time and the practices that lead to the development of antimicrobial resistance. It is concluded that most of the students identify malpractice as the trigger for bacterial resistance, however their knowledge is not adequate to avoid antibiotic resistance to humans. It is recommended to reinforce the courses of microbiology, pharmacology and virology in the Veterinary Medicine and Zootechnics degree, as well as to be updated on alternatives such as the use of phytobiotics."
