            "text": "Copper (Cu) is a widely used catalyst for the nitrate reduction reaction (NO 3 RR), but its susceptibility to surface oxidation and complex electrochemical conditions hinders the identification of active sites.Here, we employed electropolished metallic Cu with a predominant (100) surface and compared it to native oxide-covered Cu.The electropolished Cu surface rapidly oxidized after exposure to either air or electrolyte solutions.However, this oxide was reduced below 0.1 V vs. RHE, thus returning to the metallic Cu before NO 3 RR.It was distinguished from the native oxide on Cu, which remained during NO 3 RR.Fast NO 3 − and NO reduction on the metallic Cu delivered 91.5 ± 3.7% faradaic efficiency for NH 3 at −0.4 V vs. RHE.In contrast, the native oxide on Cu formed undesired products and low NH 3 yield.Operando shell-isolated nanoparticle-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SHINERS) analysis revealed the adsorbed NO 3 − , NO 2 , and NO species on the electropolished Cu as the intermediates of NH 3 .Low overpotential NO 3 − and NO adsorptions and favorable NO reduction are key to increased NH 3 productivity over Cu samples, which was consistent with the DFT calculation on Cu(100).−5][6]There is growing interest in using reactive nitrogen pollutants as an NH 3 source to address environmental concerns and explore clean energy alternatives.Electrochemical NO 3[18]NO 39][20]Two key steps determine activity and selectivity; (i) the initial NO 3 − reduction to nitrite (*NO 2 ) is the rate-determining step.The sluggish process caused signicant onset overpotential.21,22(ii)The *NO binding strength on the catalyst signicantly impacts selective NH 3 production.][23][24]Various catalysts have been investigated to optimize *NO 3 − and *NO adsorption.Copper (Cu) emerges as the most economical choice in addition to its ability to create a signicant potential gap between NO 3 − reduction and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER).Both Cu(111) 25-28 and (100) facets 9,29 exhibited reasonable activity in overall processes, and their performance was further enhanced when forming alloys or"
