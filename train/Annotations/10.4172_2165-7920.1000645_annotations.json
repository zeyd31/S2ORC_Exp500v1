            "text": "Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis is a rare disease of alveolar surfactant accumulation. Primary, autoimmune etiology accounts for 90% of cases. This report presents a case of secondary alveolar proteinosis, a metal worker with a pulmonary infection who was subsequently diagnosed with alveolar proteinosis based on the results of bronchoalveolar lavage and lung biopsy. He underwent complete resolution of the alveolar proteinosis after whole lung lavage and change of his workplace. Long term follow-up hasn't shown any sequelae and he has suffered no relapse. This favorable disease course is representative of secondary alveolar proteinosis with a reversible causative agent."
