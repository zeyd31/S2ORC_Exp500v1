            "text": "Throughout centuries, many interpretations of miraculous healings have been offered by philosophers, theologians, physicians and psychologists.Different approaches to miracles originate from the differences in understanding of causative factors, concepts of nature and the relationship between God and nature.Despite many skeptical arguments, a vast majority of people (approximately 70%) in modern Western societies share a belief in miracles and millions of sick people pilgrimage to sanctuaries seeking their occurrence.The aim of the research was to describe the social perception of miraculous healings, and the relationship between beliefs in miraculous healings, religiosity and meaning in life.A survey was conducted on a group of 178 respondents aged 18 to 30 (M = 21.5;SD = 2.31), 90% Catholics.The obtained results show that it is possible to describe the perception of miraculous healings in category of the essence of the causative factors (natural/supranatural) and definiteness (defined/undefined).The majority (88%) of the respondents believed in miracles and most frequently associated them with God's action/intervention, less often with the still undiscovered possibilities of the human organism or the nature, and the least with medical biases.Respondents with stronger religiosity more often understood miraculous healings as an act of God than the activity of unspecified supernatural powers.Moreover, higher religiosity and understanding of miraculous healings as an effect of the supernatural specified determinant was connected with higher meaning in life."
