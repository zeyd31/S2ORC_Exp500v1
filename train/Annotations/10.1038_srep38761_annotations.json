            "text": "Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells (TREM) has been broadly studied in inflammatorydisease. However, the expression and function of TREM-2 remain undiscovered in acquired cholesteatoma. The expression of TREM-2 was significantly higher in human acquired cholesteatoma than in normal skin from the external auditory canal, and its expression level was positively correlated with the severity of bone destruction. Furthermore, TREM-2 was mainly expressed on dendritic cells (DCs). In human acquired cholesteatoma, the expression of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, TNF-α and IL-6) and matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-2, MMP-8 and MMP-9) were up-regulated, and their expression levels were positively correlated with TREM-2 expression. Osteoclasts were activated in human acquired cholesteatoma. In an animal model, TREM-2 was up-regulated in mice with experimentally acquired cholesteatoma. TREM-2 deficiency impaired the maturation of experimentally acquired cholesteatoma and protected against bone destruction induced by experimentally acquired cholesteatoma. Additional data showed that TREM-2 up-regulated IL-1β and IL-6 expression via TLR4 instead of the TLR2 signaling pathway and promoted MMP-2 and MMP-8 secretion and osteoclast activation in experimentally acquired cholesteatoma. Therefore, TREM-2 might enhance acquired cholesteatoma-induced bone destruction by amplifying the inflammatory response via TLR4 signaling pathways and promoting MMP secretion and osteoclast activation.Human acquired cholesteatoma was identified more than 3 centuries ago and has a high morbidity rate; approximately 9 per 100,000 individuals are diagnosed annually around the world 1 . Characterized by constant keratinized epithelial proliferation 2 and temporal bone destruction 3 , human acquired cholesteatoma can erode ossicles and temporal bone and destroy inner structures, such as vascular, neural and adjacent central nervous system structures 4 . This disease causes hearing loss, labyrinthitis, facial paralysis and even brain abscess 5 . Most otologists consider that acquired cholesteatoma-induced bone destruction is an extremely complicated process that involves many factors, such as mechanical pressure, inflammatory response, MMP expression, osteoclast activation and pH changes. Recent studies have demonstrated that the inflammatory response is the most important factor in inflammatory disease-induced bone destruction.The bone destruction process can be divided into two stages. The first stage is bone matrix destruction, which has been proven to be the starting point of the entire bone destruction process and is mainly accomplished by MMPs 6 . As a type of incision enzyme that is dependent on metallic ions (e.g., Ca 2+ and Zn 2+ ), the MMP family includes 26 members with similar structures. Among these enzymes, 23 MMPs are expressed in human beings. MMPs can degrade almost all the protein components of the extracellular matrix and have been proven to influence embryonic development, tumor migration, inflammatory response and bone destruction 7 . In inflammatory diseases, MMP secretion can be induced by proinflammatory cytokines (including IL-1β , TNF-α , and IL-6) and plasmin. The second stage is bone substance destruction, which is accomplished by osteoclasts. Osteoclasts are differentiated from monocyte/macrophage lineage cells 8 . Osteoclast activation is the most important process in bone destruction 9-11 . Acquired cholesteatoma is a chronic bacterial infection disease 12 whose pathology is associated with innate immunity but is not clearly understood 13 . The most common bacteria related to this disease are Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus 14 . As a type of molecule expressed on the surface of innate immunity cells, pathogen-associated molecular pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs)15. In addition, the interaction between PRRs and PAMPs is the key to initiating innate immunity 15 . PRRs include several families, such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and TREMs. During the past few decades, the prevalence of PRRs has been observed, and many benefits have been achieved 16 . Numerous new PRR families have been discovered that have proven to be essential for the inflammatory response. In human acquired cholesteatoma, the function of TLRs has been extensively studied17,18, and the results showed that TLR4 was responsible for the inflammatory response and for osteoclast differentiation and activation via the RANK/RANKL pathway 19 . This achievement provides new insight into human acquired cholesteatoma-induced bone destruction.Similar to TLRs, TREMs are a family of receptors associated with inflammatory responses. TREM transmembrane glycoproteins belong to the single immunoglobulin variable (IgV) domain receptor family 20 . Genes encoding TREMs map to human chromosome 6p21.1 and mouse chromosome 17C3 21 . There are five members in the TREM family, including TREM-1, -2, -3, -4 and -5, among which TREM-3 is only expressed in mice, whereas the other receptors are expressed in both humans and mice. Over the past few decades, TREM-1 has been widely studied in inflammatory diseases. However, TREM-2 studies are still in the initial stages, and studies of TREM-3, -4, and -5 have not yet begun. TREM-2 is expressed on myeloid cells, including macrophages, dendritic cells (DCs) and microglia22,23. A number of studies have indicated that TREM-2 can amplify the inflammatory response, whereas other studies have presented contradictory results. Correale et al. reported that TREM-2 induced an inflammatory response and caused mucous membrane remodeling in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) 24 . However, Zhu et al. 25  reported that TREM-2 mediated bacteria-killing and alleviated the inflammatory response in bacterial keratitis. Similarly, Takahashi et al. 26  suggested that TREM-2 was a novel target for inflammation resolution in multiple sclerosis. Studies by Humphrey et al. 27,28revealed that TREM-2 regulated osteoclast differentiation and function and led to bone destruction, which caused disabilities in patients with Nasu-Hakola disease. However, TREM-2 inhibits osteoclasts activation in a syndrome characterized by presenile dementia and bone cysts 29 . Therefore, TREM-2 function is enigmatic in osteoclastogenesis and whether TREM-2 still promotes osteoclasts activation in inflammatory diseases is not unclear. There are still many challenges in studying the TREM family. For instance, the origin of the secretory TREMs is unclear, and these TREMs are believed to be correlated with the severity of various inflammatory diseases 30 .Currently, there are no studies exploring whether TREM-2 is expressed in human acquired cholesteatoma or its association with bone destruction. Based on the studies by other researchers, the reported roles of TREM-2 prompted us to propose the hypothesis that TREM-2 was likely to play a critical role in the development of human acquired cholesteatoma and bone destruction. This paper focuses on TREM-2 expression and the potential mechanisms by which it induces bone destruction. Furthermore, the specific mechanism by which TREM-2 functions in human acquired cholesteatoma is clarified to provide a new target to inhibit human acquired cholesteatoma-induced bone destruction."
