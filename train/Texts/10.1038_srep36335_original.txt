Bar graph shows the mean ± SD of serum melatonin levels of the two strains measured by ELISA at ZT6 and ZT18 (n = 6). Student t-test was performed to confirm that there was no statistical significance between the two strains or between the two ZT points within a strain. NS: not statistically significant. Figure S4 C57BL/6J   Oral supplementation with fat (a) or KB (b) or intraperitoneal administration of nicotinamide (c) did not alter total wheel running activities and free running period of ApoE -/mice (n = 6 for both ApoE -/and C57BL/6J mice).

. S4 The full-length blots for SIRT1 and β-actin from ApoE -/and C57BL/6J SCN. The images of SIRT1 and β-actin after ECL detection were captured using ImageQuant LAS 4000 mini and a series of exposures were taken. A long (a) and short (b) exposure are shown. Some bands appear none specific. Only the bands with the relevant molecule size were cropped and presented inFig. 5.DDDegeneration and energy shortage in the suprachiasmatic nucleus underlies the circadian rhythm disturbance in ApoE -/mice, implications for Alzheimer's disease Lan Zhou, Qian Gao, Meng Nie, Jing-Li Gu, Wei Hao, Lin Wang and Ji-Min CaoFigure S5

Representative actograph showing the wheel-running activity of ApoE -/mice fed with regular chow, then switched to regular chow containing 1% of glucose (w/w) for 7 days and finally switched back to regular chow (the start of the treatment indicated by solid arrow and the end of the treatment indicated by arrowhead). energy shortage in the suprachiasmatic nucleus underlies the circadian rhythm disturbance in ApoE -/mice, implications for Alzheimer's disease Lan Zhou, Qian Gao, Meng Nie, Jing-Li Gu, Wei Hao, Lin Wang and Ji-Min CaoFigure S6
