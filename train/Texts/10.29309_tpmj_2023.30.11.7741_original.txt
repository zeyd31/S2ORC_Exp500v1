To compare the efficacy of micro-marsupialization with surgical excision for the treatment of mucoceles originating from the minor salivary glands of the lower lip.Our primary endpoints were the mean procedural time and the duration of post-operative healing.Study Design: Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT).

INTRODUCTION

Most commonly occurring benign lesion in the minor salivary glands of the lower lip is mucocele. 1,2Clinical characteristics include a well-defined, bluish, fluctuant, non-tender cystic swelling, which has a normal overlying mucosa. 3he underlying causes of mucocele development are minor salivary gland duct obstruction or trauma.Microscopically, mucoceles are classified as mucous retention cysts and mucous extravasation cysts.The former, considered as pseudocysts, result from traumatic events such as lip biting, while the latter are true cysts that occur from the blockage of ducts of minor salivary glands leading to retention of glandular secretions. 4travasation mucoceles exhibit a higher prevalence in individuals below the age of 30, constituting more than 80% of all mucocele cases, while retention mucoceles have a lower occurrence rate comprising approximately 20% of cases and are more common in older patients. 5Within the oral cavity, the mucosa of the lower lip has a high frequency of involvement, however, mucoceles can also manifest in other regions of the oral cavity including the buccal mucosa, palate, tongue, and floor of mouth. 5he prevalence of oral mucocele in American population is reported as 0.25%, 0.08% in Brazil, and 0.11% in Sweden.Mucocele is considered as the 17th most commonly encountered lesion in the oral cavity. 6tps://doi.org/10.29309/TPMJ/2023.30.11.7741 2 Different treatment approaches have been described for mucocele management.The conventional procedure is the surgical excision of mucocele and the removal of associated glands.However, considering various postoperative complications, alternative therapeutic approaches, such as micro marsupialization, which presents reduced morbidity and enhanced outcomes, have been suggested in scholarly literature. 1,7cromarsupialization represents a non-surgical technique involving the passage of a 3.0 silk suture through the internal part of the lesion at its widest diameter.By the application of finger pressure at the site from where the needle penetrates the lesion, the accumulated fluid is extravasated and a surgical knot is made keeping a space between the lesion and the knot and left in situ for a period of 20 days.A new epithelial tract is formed along the path of the suture leading to the resolution of the lesion. 2,7,8Micromarsupialization is a less invasive, economically effective, and less extensive surgical procedure. 7It takes less time for the procedure and can be readily performed without general anesthesia on an outpatient basis in both adult and pediatric patients. 2Studies have shown that the average surgical time is 7.46 ± 1.71 minutes required for micromarsupialization, compared to 36.4 ± 6.901 minutes for surgical excision.Furthermore, the duration of postoperative healing is documented as 4.5 ± 0.535 days for micromarsupialization, in contrast to 6.29 ± 0.95 days for surgical excision. 9e primary goal of this research is to conduct a comparative analysis between micromarsupialization, an alternative less invasive technique, and conventional surgical excision for management of mucoceles.Micromarsupialization technique has numerous advantages, and these include minimal morbidity, diminished recurrence potential, shorter surgical duration, fast postoperative recovery and enhanced patient tolerance.


MATERIAL & METHODS

This study was conducted in the Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Department at Faisalabad Medical University, Faisalabad.The duration of the study was six months.The sample size was determined using the WHO sample size calculator for 2 means, considering an anticipated population mean of 4.5 and a test value of the population mean of 6.29.The pooled standard deviation was 0.77, with a power of study set at 90% and a level of significance of 5%.The final sample size for the study was 60 participants, with 30 individuals assigned to each group.

The study design was a Randomized Controlled Trial, with the sampling approach being nonprobability consecutive sampling.Medical history and related data of the patients were collected and patients were categorized in two groups for performing micromarsupialization or surgical excision.The study included patients diagnosed with a recently occurring mucocele originating from the minor salivary glands on the lower lip, with a fluid-filled consistency and sessile base with an age range of 15 to 50 years of any gender.

Conversely, patients diagnosed with mucoceles of a fibrous consistency were excluded from the study.Patients who were compromised medically such as uncontrolled diabetes, cardiovascular problems and liver disease were also excluded.Patients who presented with a recurrence of mucocele were also excluded from the study.Patients with habits of smoking, alcohol, and tobacco abuse were not included as well.Noncompliant patients for follow-up visits were not considered for participation in the study.


RESULTS

This study included a total of 60 patients comprising 40 males and 20 females.The distribution of patients in both groups based on gender is summarized in


DISCUSSION

Oral mucocele manifests as saliva accumulation due to obstruction or blockage of minor salivary gland ducts.The condition usually manifests with a rapid onset, fluctuates in size, and has a tendency to spontaneously resolve over time. 1 Oral mucoceles are usually painless lesions and are located most commonly on the lower lip.On a clinical basis, oral mucoceles can be divided into two types: Superficial mucoceles present superficially in the mucosa and classical mucoceles appearing in the upper submucosa.Superficial mucoceles are bluish colored, fluid-filled like swelling, whereas the classical mucoceles are present deep, nodular in nature and seen as normal pink colored mucosa. 4coceles exhibit variability in size, with the potential to remain stable in size over a period of several months.Without intervention, these lesions have the potential to undergo alterations in their size, characterized by reaching to a very small size or significant enlargement resulting from rupture and mucin production. 10e pathological formation of mucocele occurs due to trauma from lip biting, which causes a breach of the salivary duct.Consequently, the excretory duct of a salivary gland ruptures and accumulation of saliva occurs within the surrounding tissues, ultimately resulting in the formation of a mucocele. 6pending on the size of the lesion, surgical method is the most common treatment option employed for mucocele.However, cryosurgery, electrosurgery, and laser surgery have also been proven techniques with good results. 9rious surgical options for the treatment of mucoceles diagnosed on the lips, cheeks, and palate are: 1.


Surgical excision 2. Marsupialization 3. Dissection

Small mucoceles can be successfully treated through surgical excision of the lesion.However, this method carries a higher risk of mucocele recurrence.On the other hand, for larger mucoceles, the most appropriate treatment approach is marsupialization, which involves an unroofing procedure.Marsupialization is preferred over other methods such as excision or dissection due to the inherent challenges and potential risks associated with the latter methods, such as the potential damage to vital structures.

It is important to note that the marsupialization technique is also associated with an increased incidence of mucocele recurrences. 9cromarsupialization is a non-surgical and less invasive technique performed under local anesthesia.In micromarsupialization, a 3.0 silk suture is passed through the inner surface of the lesion from its wide base and then the lesion is compressed to drain the fluid by applying digital pressure.A surgical knot is subsequently secured, leading to the formation of a newly epithelialized tract that follows the trajectory of the suture.The procedure can be completed in a short time of at least 3 minutes, and it causes less tissue injury and fibrosis.This pilot study employed a small sample size which may have contributed to these results.There was no statistically significant difference in the lesion resolution or duration of post-operative healing between the two groups.


CONCLUSION

The findings of this study indicated that micromarsupialization may offer several advantages over surgical excision as a therapeutic approach for mucoceles arising from the minor salivary glands.These advantages are the short procedural time of the technique employed, reduced post-operative healing period and low recurrence rate.This method is simple, easy to perform for the operator, has less postoperative complications and good patient's tolerance.Copyright© 31 Aug, 2023.Data collection and analysis.
