Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (A Case Study Of Drini Beach, Gunungkidul, Indonesia)" by Hendy Fatchurohman et al., Nat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci. Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-2021-221-AC2, 2021Dear Referee, We want to say thank you for your time reviewing our manuscript. Thank you for pointing this out. We will improve the interpretation to provide more results, especially related to the physical process of the rip current. However, we consider this study preliminary since this method has never been applied in Indonesia. We found that this method is feasible, effective, and applied on a broader scale in Indonesia.Powered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org)
