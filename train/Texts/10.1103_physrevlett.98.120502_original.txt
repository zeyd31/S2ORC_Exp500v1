arXiv:quant-ph/0609174v1 22 Sep 2006 NMR experiment factors numbers with Gauss sums
(Dated: April 1, 2022)
We factor the number 157573 using an NMR implementation of Gauss sums. PACS numbers: 03.67.Lx, 03.67.-a, 82.56.-b, 02.10.De According to the legend[1] Karl Friedrich Gauss as a child was given by his teacher the problem of adding all integers up to a given number m. His elegant solution rearranges the terms of the series in a convenient way arriving at the result m k=1
k = 1 2 m(m + 1)(1)
which depends quadratically on m. In his adult life Gauss revisited square dependencies in the context of number theory [2] when he calculated the sum of quadratic phase factors which today carry the name Gauss sums [3]. In this contribution we present the first implementation of a factorization algorithm [4,5] based on Gauss sums [6] by factorizing the number N = 157573 using NMR techniques. It is intriguing that the physical realization relies on the sum formula Eq. (1). Factorization of numbers into their prime factors is considered a hard non-polynomial problem [7] for classical computers. It was Shor [8] who proposed a quantum algorithm which can solve the problem on a quantum computer [9] with a tremendous speedup as compared to a classical computer. Vandersypen et al. [10] demonstrated in an NMR implementation of the Shor algorithm with seven qubits the factorization of the number 15 = 3 · 5.

Gauss sums are the discrete version of the Fresnel integrals [11] familiar from classical optics effects such as diffraction from a wedge or the Feynman formulation of quantum mechanics. Thus they are a sum rather than an integral over quadratic phase factors. Due to this discreteness Gauss sums have interesting periodicity properties which manifest themselves in the Talbot effect [12], fractional revivals [13] or curlicues [14]. Due to this periodicity property they not only play an important role in number theory but are also an ideal tool to factor numbers. Indeed several such Gauss sum factorization algorithms [4,5,15,16,17,18] have been put forward. All these schemes capitalize on the periodicity properties but differ in their method of implementation ranging from a N -slit Young interferometer [15] via molecules [16] and wave packet dynamics [17] to chirped laser pulses interacting with atoms [4,5,18]. However, so far no experimental demonstration of this approach has been provided [19].

In the present paper we use NMR techniques to realize a rather special Gauss sum which brings out factors with a remarkable contrast even when only a few terms appear in the sum. We start by briefly summarizing the essential ingredients of our scheme. Since we do not employ entanglement yet, we still need exponential resources. Nevertheless, the quasi-random interference [20] contained in the Gauss sums allows us to work with only a few terms in the sum. In the experiment this advantageous feature translates into the need for a few pulses within a decay time of the system only. We then turn to the experiment and demonstrate the power of the scheme for a number with six digits, but emphasize that extensions to much larger numbers are within reach.

Our experiment implements the Gauss sum [21] A (M)
N (ℓ) = 1 M + 1 M m=0 exp −2πi m 2 N ℓ ,(2)
with M + 1 terms and N is the number to be factored. The argument ℓ with 1 ≤ ℓ ≤ √ N scans through all integers between 1 and √ N for possible factors. The capability of the Gauss sum, Eq. (2), to factor numbers stems from the fact that for an integer factor q of N with N = q · r all phases in A  In this process of destructive interference the truncation parameter M plays a crucial role. Indeed, already a few terms in the sum are sufficient to discriminate factors from non-factors in the signal |A Next we address the complexity of our factorization scheme. To gain information on the factors of N we have to measure the signal |A We now turn to our experimental realization of a Gauss sum. In the original proposal [4] the Gauss sum arises through the time evolution of a two-level atom whose transition frequency increases linearly in time and which is driven by a train of laser pulses. In our experiment we subject an ensemble of spins I = 1/2 to a specific sequence of RF pulses as shown in Fig. 3. They lead to a sequence of signals which when summed represent a Gauss sum closely related to Eq. (2).

FIG. 3: NMR implementation of our factorization scheme using Gauss sums. The y-pulse which prepares the initial density matrix ρin is followed after a time τ by a pulse which imprints the phase φ0 on the spins. This pulse is the first of a sequence of M + 1 pulses each imprinting a different phase φm. At times τm + τ ≡ (2m + 1)τ + τ we measure the echo, that is the polarization sm in x-direction and sum the echos sm over all m to obtain S (M ) . In order to implement a Gauss sum the phases φm need to be proportional to the number N to be factored and have to increase linearly as a function of m since the spin dynamics expressed by sm depends on the sum over all phases of the previous pulses.

In our experiment we use H 2 O as an ensemble of protons with nuclear spin 1/2 in Boltzmann equilibrium at room temperature described by a density operator ρ B ≡ ½/2−ǫ I z , with the identity operator ½ and 0 < ǫ ≪ 1. Throughout the paper we use the notation I j ≡ σ j /2 where σ j are the familiar Pauli spin matrices. Radio frequency pulses are applied at the Larmor frequency 400 MHz of the protons. Experiments were performed with a Varian Infinity Plus NMR spectrometer applying a cycle time of t c = 2τ = 100µs and with relaxation time T 2 ≈ 200ms. The pulse sequence shown in Fig. 3 is based on the Carr, Purcell, Meiboom and Gill (CPMG)sequence [22,23] which was proposed almost 50 years ago for measuring T 2 relaxation times in inhomogeneous fields. For our purpose we have modified this sequence such that the resulting evolution of the proton spins expressed by a sequence of echos which leads to the desired Gauss sum.

The pulse sequence consists of an initiating π/2-pulse in y-direction which creates the initial density matrix ρ in ≡ ½/2 − ǫ I x . This pulse is followed by a series of M + 1 π-pulses with separation 2τ which are individually phase shifted with respect to the x-axis of the rotating frame by an angle φ k [24,25]. In the laboratory system the corresponding Hamiltonian reads
H(t) = ω 0 I z + 2π M k=0 δ(t − τ k ) cos(ωτ k − φ k ) I x(3)
where ω 0 and ω denote the frequencies of the transition and the driving field, respectively. The pulses act at times τ k ≡ (2k + 1)τ and the phases φ k will be chosen later in order to obtain a Gauss sum. With the help of the identity
U j (α) ≡ exp(−iαI j ) = cos(α/2) ½ − 2i sin(α/2) I j(4)
the Hamiltonian H within the rotating wave approximation, that is in the frame rotating with the frequency ∆ω = ω 0 − ω takes the form
H = ∆ω I z + π M k=0 δ(t − τ k ) (cos φ k I x + sin φ k I y )(5)
and the resulting time evolution operator
U k ≡ U z (∆ωτ )U z (φ k )U x (π)U † z (φ k )U z (∆ωτ )(6)
of the k-th cycle reflects the three stages shown in Fig. 3: (i) Free time evolution for the time τ followed by (ii) a π-pulse which imprints the phase φ k , and (iii) another free time evolution during the time τ . The π-pulse eliminates the effects of the free time evolution and ensures that the decoherence due to an inhomogeneous distribution of local fields is compensated by refocussing. At times τ m + τ we measure the polarization
s m ≡ Tr (I x ρ m ) Tr (I x ρ in ) (7) in x-direction with ρ m ≡ ρ(τ m + τ ) = U m ρ in U † m where U m ≡ U(τ m + τ ) = m
k=0 U k is the product of the time evolution operators U k due to all previous pulses.

When we apply Eq. (4) to Eq. (6) we find
U k = (−i) 0 e −i φ k e i φ k 0 (8)
which yields for the sum S (M) ≡ M m=0 s m over the signals s m given by Eq. (7) the expression
S (M) = M m=0 cos m k=0 (−1) k 2φ k .(9)
Hence, the spin dynamics expressed by the signal s m depends on its complete history, that is the phases of all previous pulses. In particular, they enter as an alternating sum. It is here that the sum Eq. (1) of the young Gauss comes into play. When we compare S (M) to the Gauss sum of Eq. (2) we recognize that for the choice
φ k = (−1) k (2k − 1)π N ℓ for k ≥ 1 0 for k = 0(10)
of the phases φ k Eq. (9) takes the form
1 M + 1 S (M) = 1 M + 1 M m=0 cos 2π m 2 N ℓ ≡ C (M) N (ℓ)(11)
with C
(M) N = Re A (M)
N . In Fig. 4 we display the results of our NMR implementation of our factorization scheme based on Gauss sums for N = 157573 = 13 · 17 · 23 · 31. On the top we show the time evolution of the spin under the influence of the particular pulse sequence given by the Hamiltonian H and the phases φ k defined by Eqs. (3) and (10), respectively. As a measure of the dynamics we show the echo signal s m following from Eq. (7). For factors of N such as ℓ = 17 the signal is constant. Consequently we find for the average C N (ℓ = 18), shown by the arrow. We emphasize that due to the quasi-random interference of Gauss sums M = 11 terms are sufficient to discriminate factors from non-factors.

Although decoherence is not a limiting factor in our scheme it is still interesting to investigate its influence. We take incoherent processes into account phenomenologically by introducing a T 2 relaxation process and Eq. (9) is modified
C (M) N (ℓ) = 1 M + 1 M m=0 exp −m 2τ T 2 cos 2π m 2 N ℓ .(12)
We find that even for an appreciable decay, that is for 2M τ /T 2 = 2 at the end of the sequence the pattern shown in Fig. 1 by circles looks almost identical to the one without decoherence indicated by black dots, except for the reduced scale of the signal strength. This result is surprising since the signal s M at the end of the sequence has decayed to 13.5% of its initial value. Hence, decoherence does not significantly influence our ability to distinguish factors from non-factors. In summary we have presented the first experimental implementation of a factorizing algorithm based on Gauss sums with an ensemble of single qubits. We have exemplified this technique factoring the number N = 157573. However, we claim that extensions to larger numbers are readily possible since our method capitalizes on the quasi-randomness of the phases of Gauss sums. As an outlook we factor in Fig. 5  with only M = 200 pulses. Since in NMR it is possible to even have up to 10 4 pulses within the decay time T 2 several new questions emerge: (i) What is the optimal number M of terms in the Gauss sum, that is how many pulses are needed for a given N in order to discriminate factors from non-factors? (ii) How to overcome pulse errors? and (iii) how to employ entanglement in order to achieve a speed-up?

Obviously, the answers require a more detailed analysis. Therefore we can only speculate. However, our numerical experiments suggest a logarithmic dependence of M on N . In addition, pulse error correction techniques based on optimal control theory offer themselves. Finally, the entanglement of two and more spins might open a possibility to reduce the complexity.

are integer multiples of 2π. Consequently the terms add up constructively and yield A(M) N (q) = 1 as shown in Fig. 1 by black dots. When ℓ is not a factor the quadratic phases oscillate rapidly with m and A (M) N takes on small values.

In order to analyze the dependence of this surprising feature on M we define the contrast[11] V ≡ (1 − a)/(1 + a) of the factorization interference pattern in complete analogy to classical optics where a ≡ n0 ℓ ′ =1 |A (M) N (ℓ ′ )|/n 0 denotes the average value of the sum at the non-factors upto √ N . Indeed, n 0 is the closest integer to √ N and the summation runs over all arguments ℓ ′ which are not factors of N . In Fig. 2 we show V for different values of N . Already a relatively small number of terms M results in good contrast of the signal.

Since at most √ N data-points {ℓ, |A (M) N (ℓ)|} have to be acquired, we estimate the required resources as √ N = exp [L/2] where L = log N is the number of digits of N . Although our scheme scales exponentially we profit from the small number of terms M necessary to distill the factors.

For factors such as ℓ = 17 the signals sm are approximately constant as a function of m with an average value C (M )N (17) close to unity. In contrast, for a non-factor such as ℓ = 18 sm oscillates around zero and when summed over m almost averages out as indicated by the arrow.
