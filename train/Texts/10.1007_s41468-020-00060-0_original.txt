Let TCr(X) denote the r-th topological complexity of a space X. In many cases, the generating function r≥1 TCr+1(X)x r is a rational function P (x)(1−x) 2 where P (x) is a polynomial with P (1) = cat(X), that is, the asymptotic growth of TCr(X) with respect to r is cat(X). In this paper, we introduce a lower bound MTCr(X) of TCr(X) for a rational space X, and estimate the growth of MTCr(X).

Introduction

For a space X, let X r denote the r-th Cartesian procuct of X, and let ∆ r : X → X r denote the diagonal map ∆ r (x) = (x, x, . . . , x) for x ∈ X. The r-th topological complexity TC r (X) of a space X is defined to be the least integer n such that there is an open cover X r = U 0 ∪U 1 ∪· · ·∪U r having the property that each U i has a homotopy section s i : U i → X of ∆ r , that is, ∆ r •s i is homotopic to the inclusion U i → X r . Then TC 2 (X) is the topological complexity of Farber [2], and TC r (X) for r > 2 is the higher topological complexity of Rudyak [10]. It is known that TC r (X) is a homotopy invariant of X.

For a space X, we can define a formal power series
F X (x) = ∞ r=1 TC r+1 (X)x r .
In [4], Farber and Oprea asked the following question. Let cat(X) denote the LS-category of a space X. Question 1.1. For which finite CW-complex X, F X (x) is a rational function
P (x) (1 − x) 2 such that P (x) is a polynomial with P (1) = cat(X)?
As is observed in [3], Question 1.1 is asking whether or not TC r+1 (X) = TC r (X) + cat(X) for all r large enough. Farber, Kishimoto and Stanley [3] proved that if TC r (X) = zcl r (X; k) and cat(X) = cup(X; k) for some field k and all r large enough, then F X (x) satisfies the condition in Question 1.1, where zcl r (X; k) and cup(X; k) denote the r-th zero-divisors cup-length and the cup-length of X over k, respectively. They also showed that F X (x) does not always satisfy the condition in Question 1.1.

In [9], Jessup, Murillo and Parent defined the module topological complexity, which is a lower bound for the topological complexity of rational spaces. We will define its higher analog, r-th module topological complexity MTC r (X) for a rational space X, and prove: Theorem 1.2. Let X be a simply-connected rational space of finite rational type. Then for
r ≥ 2, cup(X; Q) ≤ MTC r+1 (X) − MTC r (X) ≤ 2cat(X).
Let X be a simply-connected rational space of finite rational type. We define
F X (x) = ∞ r=1 MTC r+1 (X)x r .
As an application of Theorem 1.2, one gets:
Corollary 1.3. Let X be a simply-connected rational space of finite rational type. If cat(X) = cup(X; Q), then F X (x) = P (x) (1−x) 2 where P (x)
is an integer polynomial with P (1) = cat(X).

If MTC r (X) = TC r (X), then Theorem 1.2 gives an estimate of the growth of TC r (X) and Corollary 1.3 gives a criterion for Question 1.1. In view of the celebrated result of Hess [8], one can naively expect that MTC r (X) = TC r (X). Here we give a class of rational spaces, for which one has MTC r (X) = TC r (X). Theorem 1.4. Let X be a simply-connected rational space of finite rational type such that π i (X) = 0 for i even. Then MTC r (X) = TC r (X) = (r − 1)cat(X).

There is an immediate corollary.
Corollary 1.5. Let X be a simply-connected rational space of finite rational type such that π i (X) = 0 for i even. Then F X (x) = P (x) (1−x) 2 where P (x) is an integer polynomial with P (1) = cat(X).
By applying Theorem 1.4, we give a rational space X, to which the criterion of Farber, Kishimoto and Stanley [3] mentioned in Section 1 does not apply, but F X (x) satisfies the condition of Question 1.1.

Example 1.6. Let X be a simply-connected rational space whose minimal model is given by Λ(x, y, z), |x| = |y| = 3, |z| = 5, dx = dy = 0, dz = xy.

Then by Corollary 1.5, F X (x) satisfies the condition of Question 1.1. Since H * (X; Q) = x, y, xz, yz, xyz , one has H * (X; Q) 2r−1 = 0, implying zcl r (X; Q) ≤ 2(r − 1). On the other hand, the Toomer invariant of X is 3, which coincides with cat(X) because X is elliptic. Then by Theorem 1.4,
MTC r (X) = (r − 1)cat(X) = 3(r − 1).
In particular, zcl r (X; Q) < MTC r (X) for all r ≥ 2.

Instability of the growth

As mentioned above, Question (1.1) is asking whether or not TC r+1 (X) = TC r (X)+cat(X) for all r large enough. In this section, we observe why we need to consider large r, instead of all r.

Let Γ be a finite simple graph. Let c(Γ) be the cardinality of the maximal clique of Γ, and let z r (Γ) be the maximum of
r i=1 |C i | where C 1 , . . . , C r are cliques of Γ such that r i=1 C i = ∅.
Example 2.1. Let Γ be the following graph.
t t t t t t ✡ ✡ ✡ ✡ ✡ ✡ ✡ ❏ ❏ ❏ ❏ ❏ ❏ ❏ ❏ ❏ ❏ ❏ ✡ ✡ ✡ ✡
Clearly, c(Γ) = 3, and since any two of 3-cliques intersect, z 2 (Γ) = 5. Since three side 3-cliques do not intersect, z 3 (Γ) = 9, implying z r (Γ) = 3r for r ≥ 3.

Let A Γ denote the right-angled Artin group over Γ. The following are proved by Gonzalez, Gutierrez and Yuzvinsky [7] and Farber and Oprea [4]. Now we are ready to prove the following, which shows us the reason why we need to consider the growth of TC r (X) for all r large enough, instead of all r. Proposition 2.3. Given an integer n ≥ 2, there is a space X such that TC n+1 (X) − TC n (X) > cat(X) and TC r+1 (X) − TC r (X) = cat(X) for all r large enough.

Proof. Let Γ n be the 1-skeleton of a simplicial complex obtained from an n-simplex by attaching an n-simplex on each (n − 1)-face. Then Γ 2 is the graph in Example 2.1. One may assume that the vertex set of Γ n is {0, 1, . . . , 2n + 1} and maximal cliques of Γ n are C 0 , C 1 , . . . , C n+1 , where C 0 = {0, 1, . . . , n} and C i = {0, 1, . . . , i, . . . , n, n + i + 1} for 0 ≤ i ≤ n. By definition, c(Γ n ) = n + 1. For r ≤ n, any r of C 0 , . . . , C n+1 intersect, and C 1 ∩ · · · ∩ C r−1 ∩ (C r − {r}) = ∅. Then z r (Γ n ) = (r − 1)(n + 1) + n = r(n + 1) − 1. For r > n, C 1 ∩ · · · ∩ C n+1 ∩ C 1 ∩ · · · ∩ C 1 r−n−1 = ∅, implying z r (Γ n ) = r(n + 1). Thus by Theorem 2.2, the proof is complete.

Remark 2.4. We would like to thank John Oprea for letting us know the instability of the growth of TC r (BA Γ 2 ), where Proposition 2.3 is its straightforward generalization. He also informed us, in a private communication, that Michael Farber and he also discovered the graph Γ n and showed that the numerator polynomial P (x) in Question 1.1 is of degree n+1, which answers another problem on the generating function F X (x) that they consider.


Module topological complexity

In what follows, let X be a simply-connected rational space of finite rational type. Let (ΛV, d) be any Sullivan model of X, and let K r denote the kernel of the multiplication
(ΛV ) ⊗r → ΛV, v 1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ v r → v 1 · · · v r .
Then as in [1], TC r (X) equals the least integer n such that the projection p r,n : (ΛV ) ⊗r → (ΛV ) ⊗r /K n+1 r has a differential graded algebra homotopy retraction. Here a homotopy retraction of p r,n means a retraction of a Sullivan model (ΛV ) ⊗r → (ΛV ) ⊗r ⊗ ΛW for the projection p r,n .

For v ∈ V and 1 ≤ i ≤ r, let v(i) = 1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ 1 ⊗ v ⊗ 1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ 1 ∈ (ΛV ) ⊗r where v is in the i-th position. Analogously to [9, Lemma 2.3], one has:
Lemma 3.1. For r ≥ 2, K r = (v(i) − v(i + 1) | v ∈ V, 1 ≤ i ≤ r − 1).
In [9], the module topological complexity MTC(X) is defined, and here we define its higher analog.

Definition 3.2. The r-th module topological complexity MTC r (X) is defined to be the least integer n such that the projection p r,n has a differential graded (ΛV ) ⊗r -module homotopy retraction.

For a space Y and a field k, let zcl r (Y ; k) be the greatest n such that there are elements x 1 , . . . , x n in the kernel of the product H * (Y ; k) ⊗n → H * (Y ; k) such that x 1 · · · x n = 0. Then one has:
Proposition 3.3. For r ≥ 2, zcl r (X; Q) ≤ MTC r (X) ≤ TC r (X).
Proof. Suppose MTC r (X) = n. Then the projection p r,n is injective in cohomology, and so there are no x 0 , . . . , x n ∈ K r such that the product x 0 · · · x n is a cocycle representing a non-trivial cohomology class of X. Thus zcl r (X; Q) ≤ n = MTC r (X). The inequality MTC r (X) ≤ TC r (X) follows at once from the definition.


Proofs of main results
Lemma 4.1. For r ≥ 2, cup(X; Q) ≤ MTC r+1 (X) − MTC r (X).
Proof. Let (ΛV, d) be a Sullivan model for X, and suppose cup(X; Q) = n. Then there are cocycles a 1 , . . . , a n ∈ ΛV such that the product a 1 · · · a n represents a non-trivial cohomology class. For each i, let
a i = 1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ 1 r−1 ⊗a i ⊗ 1 − 1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ 1 r ⊗a i ∈ (ΛV ) ⊗(r+1)
and let a =ā 1 · · ·ā n . Define a map
f : (ΛV ) ⊗r → (ΛV ) ⊗(r+1) , x → (x ⊗ 1)a.
Since a is a cocycle, f is a differential graded (ΛV ) ⊗r -module map. Let W denote a subspace of ΛV ⊗ ΛV spanned by elements of the form x ⊗ 1 − 1 ⊗ x for x ∈ ΛV and 1 ⊗ 1. Then there is a decomposition as a differential graded ΛV ⊗ 1-module
ΛV ⊗ ΛV = (ΛV ⊗ 1) · W ⊕ (ΛV ⊗ 1) · W ′ for some subspace W ′ ⊂ ΛV ⊗ ΛV .
Hence there is a decomposition as a differential graded (ΛV ) ⊗r ⊗ 1-module
(ΛV ) ⊗(r+1) = ((ΛV ) ⊗r ⊗ 1) · a ⊕ ((ΛV ) ⊗r ⊗ 1) · U
for some subspace U ⊂ (ΛV ) ⊗(r+1) , and so one gets a differential graded (ΛV ) ⊗r -module retraction of f q : (ΛV ) ⊗(r+1) → (ΛV ) ⊗r , q(a) = 1, q(U ) = 0.

It is proved in [3] that zcl r+1 (X; k) = zcl r (X; k)+cup(X; k) for any field k. Then by Lemma 3.3, MTC r+1 (X) = m + n for some non-negative integer m, and so there is a differential graded (ΛV ) ⊗(r+1) -module homotopy retraction q ′ of the projection p r+1,m+n : (ΛV ) ⊗(r+1) →
(ΛV ) ⊗(r+1) /K m+n+1 r+1
. On the other hand, since a belongs to K n r+1 , there is a commutative diagram of differential graded (ΛV ) ⊗r -modules
(ΛV ) ⊗r f / / pr,m (ΛV ) ⊗(r+1) p r+1,m+n (ΛV ) ⊗r /K m+1 rf / / (ΛV ) ⊗(r+1) /K m+n+1 r+1 .
Then q • q ′ •f is a differential graded (ΛV ) ⊗r -module homotopy retraction of the projection p r,m . Thus MTC r (X) + cup(X; Q) ≤ m + n = MTC r+1 (X).
Lemma 4.2. For r ≥ 2, MTC r+1 (X) − MTC r (X) ≤ 2cat(X).
Proof. Since there are obvious inequalities TC r (X) ≤ cat(X r ) ≤ rcat(X), it follows from Proposition 3.3 that MTC r (X) ≤ rcat(X).

There is a homotopy pullback * / / Proof of Corollary 1.3. One has MTC r (X) ≤ TC r (X) ≤ rcat(X). Also MTC r (X) + cup(X; Q) ≤ MTC r+1 by Theorem 1.2. Then the statement follows from [3, Lemma 1].

Proof of Theorem 1.4. Let (ΛV, d) be the minimal model of X. By Lemma 3.1,
K n+1 r = (v(i) − v(i + 1) | v ∈ V, 1 ≤ i ≤ r − 1) n+1
where v(i) is as in Lemma 3.1. By assumption, V has no even degree element, and so K n+1 r = 0 for n = (r − 1) dim V . On the other hand, it follows from [5, Example 6, p. 389] that cat(X) = dim V . Then one gets TC r (X) ≤ (r − 1)cat(X).

On the other hand, by (4.1), MTC r (X) ≥ (r − 1)cat(X). Thus the proof is complete by Proposition 3.3.

Theorem 2. 2 .
2For a finite simple graph Γ and r ≥ 2, cat(BA Γ ) = c(Γ) and TC r (BA Γ ) = z r (Γ).

/
/ X r where j(x 1 , . . . , x r−1 ) = (x 1 , . . . , x r−1 , * ) for (X 1 , . . . , x r−1 ) ∈ X r−1 . Then by [6, Proposition 5.5] and [5, Theorem 30.2], (4.1) MTC r (X) ≥ cat(X r−1 ) = (r − 1)cat(X). Thus MTC r+1 (X) − MTC r (X) ≤ (r + 1)cat(X) − (r − 1)cat(X) = 2cat(X), as claimed. Now we are ready to prove Theorems 1.2 and 1.4. Proof of Theorem 1.2. Combine Lemmas 4.1 and 4.2.
