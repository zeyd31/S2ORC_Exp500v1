HETEROGENEOUS ELASTIC PLATES WITH IN-PLANE MODULATION OF THE TARGET CURVATURE AND APPLICATIONS TO THIN GEL SHEETS

We rigorously derive a Kirchhoff plate theory, via Γ-convergence, from a three-dimensional model that describes the finite elasticity of a thin heterogeneous sheet. The heterogeneity in the elastic properties of the material results in a spontaneous strain that depends on both the thickness variable and on the planar variable x . At the same time, the spontaneous strain is h-close to the identity, where h is the small parameter quantifying the thickness. The 2D limiting model is constrained to the set of isometric immersions of the mid-plane of the plate into R 3 , with the corresponding energy penalizing deviations of the curvature tensor associated with a deformation from a x -dependent target curvature tensor. A discussion on the 2D minimizers is provided in the case where the target curvature tensor is piecewise constant. Finally, we apply our plate theory to the modeling of swelling-induced shape changes in heterogeneous thin gel sheets.

fabricated that can spontaneously deform in response to non-mechanical stimuli. In particular, in these systems curvature arises from heterogeneous in-plane [15,23,24,36,44] or through-thethickness strains [37,38,39,43], which are induced by heterogeneous material properties, including variable anisotropy. Thus, to study and control the emerging shapes, the derivation of plate theories for materials with heterogeneous response to external stimuli has become as a topic of interest in both the mathematical and the physical literatures [1,5,10,31,33,42].

The natural analytical tool to study these phenomena in the context of non-linear elasticity are techniques of dimensional reduction, based on the theory of Γ-convergence. Up to now, using this theory, a wide class of plate theories has been rigorously derived from three-dimensional elasticity. One can find in [19] a whole hierarchy of different 2D models, obtained in the limit of the vanishing thickness h, corresponding to different scalings in h of the elastic energy.

The aim of this paper is to provide a dimensionally reduced model describing the bending behavior of heterogeneous thin elastic sheets with in-plane modulation of the through-the-thickness variation of the spontaneous strain. More precisely, we are interested in elastic sheets Ω h := ω × (−h/2, h/2) with 0 < h 1, where ω ⊆ R 2 is the mid-plane, of a material characterized by a spontaneous stretch distribution U h of the form
U h (z) = I 3 + h B z , z 3 h , z = (z , z 3 ) ∈ Ω h . (1.1)
Here, B is a given strain distribution defined on the rescaled domain Ω := Ω 1 , with values in the space Sym(3) of the 3×3 symmetric matrices. The term spontaneous for the distribution U h means that the system would like to deform, at each point z, according to a deformation whose gradient coincides with U h (z). Observe that in most cases, which are also the most interesting ones, there is no (orientation-preserving) deformation defined globally in Ω h , with gradient coinciding with U h in the whole of Ω h . Using a terminology from Mechanics, this is equivalent to saying that the distribution U h is not kinematically compatible. Apart from a direct verification through the associated Riemann curvature tensor (see Section 2 for more details), one can read off the potential incompatibility of U h from the fact that the limiting 2D model cannot be minimized at zero.

A prototypical case to which our analysis applies is when the tensor-valued map B is of the form B(x) = x 3 C(x ), with x = (x , x 3 ) ∈ Ω, for some C(x ) ∈ Sym(3), which in turn gives U h (z) = I 3 + z 3 C(z ). (1.2) A material characterized by the spontaneous stretch distribution (1.1) can be modeled via a family of nonnegative energy density functions W h defined in Ω h ×R 3×3 , such that W h (z, F ) = 0 iff F = U h (z), modulo superposed rigid body rotations. The associated free energy of the system is then given by the integral functional
E h (v) =ˆΩ h W h z, ∇v(z) dz,
at each deformation v : Ω h → R 3 . Throughout the paper, we use the notation U h and U h for the spontaneous stretch distribution defined on the physical domain Ω h and on the rescaled domain Ω, respectively, and we follow the same notation for all the corresponding quantities such as, for example, the densities W h and W h . In particular, we have that E h (v) = h E h (y), with y(x , x 3 ) = v(x , hx 3 ), where the rescaled free-energy functionals E h are defined as in (3.1).

Apart from the energy-well structure, we make standard assumptions on the family of densities modeling the 3D system such as frame indifference and superquadratic growth, and we suppose that the rescaled family {W h } converges uniformly, as h → 0, to a limiting homogeneous density function W . We refer the reader to Section 2 for details on the assumptions on the 3D model. Thin gel sheets provide an interesting example of material which can be described through a family of densities fulfilling precisely the mentioned assumptions, as shown in Section 5 and in the forthcoming paper [4].

In Section 3, we rigorously derive the 2D plate model corresponding to the limit as h → 0 of the (physical) energies E h /h 3 . The derivation is achieved through a compactness and a Γ-convergence result involving the rescaled energies E h /h 2 (see Theorem 3.1 and Theorem 3.3). Roughly speaking, the compactness results says that a low energy sequence (E h (y h )/h 2 ≤ C) converges to a W 2,2isometry, namely to a y ∈ W 2,2 (ω, R 3 ) such that (∇y) T ∇y = I 2 a.e. in ω. At the same time, the Γ-convergence result concerns the Γ-limit of the functionals E h /h 2 to the 2D plate model defined as
E 0 (y) = 1 24ˆω Q 2 A y (x ) − A(x ) dx + ad.t. (1.3)
on each W 2,2 -isometry y, where ad.t. stays for "aditional terms" not depending on y. From the above expression we see that the dimensionally reduced model depends on each deformation y through the pull-back A y of the second fundamental form associated with y(ω) (see (3.6)). Moreover, in the above formula we have that the quadratic form Q 2 and the tensor-valued function A are related to the initial 3D model, respectively, via a relaxation of the second differential of the limiting density W at I 3 (see formulas (2.6) and (2.7)) and via the definition
A(x ) = 12ˆ1 /2 −1 /2
tB(x , t) dt, for a.e. x ∈ ω, whereB : ω → Sym(2) is obtained from the spontaneous strain distribution B appearing in (1.1) by omitting the third row and the third column. We refer the reader to Section 3 for the precise statement and proof of the compactness and Γ-convergence result. In particular, the Γ-lim sup is obtained under the assumption that curl curl D min = 0, with D min :=ˆ1
/2 −1 /2B
(·, t) dt. (1.4) This condition is connected to the construction of the recovery sequence, since it guarantees that D min is a symmetrized gradient (see the discussion just before the proof of Theorem 3.3 in Section 3). Proving the same Γ-limit without the above condition is beyond the reach of the tools used in the present paper, and we will address this issue in future work. At the same time, a perusal of Section 3 shows that, when (1.4) is satisfied, we can employ arguments already available in the literature (see e.g. [41]) to obtain a wide class of new 2D plate models. Namely, those models described by the 2D energy functional (1.3), where A is a possibly nonconstant target curvature tensor, as a consequence of the in-plane variations of the 3D spontaneous stretches U h . To complete the picture, let us mention that beam theories derived from 2D energies of the form (1.3), in the limit as ε → 0 when ω = (− /2, /2) × (ε/2 × ε/2), can be found in [3] for the case A constant and in [17] in the case A = A(x 1 ). To use a common terminology, these 1D theories may describe narrow ribbons of soft active materials.

In Section 4, we focus the attention on pointwise minimizers of E 0 , namely, on those cases where the minimum of E 0 over the class of W 2,2 -isometries is more specifically attained by isometries y realizing the condition
E 0 (y) = 1 24ˆω min F ∈F Q 2 F − A(x ) dx + ad.t.,
where F is the set of all 2×2 symmetric matrices with vanishing determinant (cfr. expression (1.3) and recall the well-known fact that A y (x ) ∈ F, for every isometry y). Far from being complete in the description of those deformations which realize the above condition, but keeping an eye on the applications, we restrict the analysis to a case which can be more easily reproduced in numerical simulations or in laboratory: that of a piecewise constant target curvature tensor. More precisely, in Theorem 4.6, we determine necessary and sufficient conditions that the piecewise constant tensorvalued map x → A(x ) has to satisfy in order to guarantee the existence of pointwise minimizers of E 0 . Under these conditions, it turns out that a pointwise minimizer y is, roughly speaking, a "patchwork" of cylinders (see Figures 1 and 2). We remark that understanding these conditions on a piecewise constant A translates into understanding the conditions under which cylinders can be patched together resulting into an isometry. Apart from being an inspiration for mathematically interesting questions, the family of energy functionals considered in this paper is relevant from the viewpoint of applications to shape morphing materials, especially in the context of swelling gels, as anticipated in the opening paragraph of the Introduction. In fact, the application to free-swelling, thin gel sheets with heterogeneous stiffness is the main motivation of the theory presented in Sections 2-4. In Section 5, we show that some typical models describing such materials are based on a family of energy densities {W h } satisfying precisely our assumptions, with a spontaneous strain distribution of the form B = b I 3 , where b is a given scalar function defined on the rescaled domain Ω.

To complete the discussion, we recall some results already present in the literature, which are close to the analysis presented in this paper. First of all, we mention the the main source of our inspiration, which is the paper [41] (see also [40]), where the seminal work [18] (providing the rigorous derivation of Kirchhoff's plate theory from three-dimensional elasticity for homogeneous materials) is generalized to the case of stressed heterogeneous multilayers. More precisely, in [41] a family of 3D energy densities of the form
W h (F ) = W (F V h ),(1.5)
is considered (and an explicit dependence on the rescaled thickness variable x 3 is also taken into account), where W is a (frame-indifferent) homogenous energy density minimized at
I 3 , V h = V h (x 3 ) = I 3 + hD(x 3 )
, and the reduced model (1.3) with A constant is rigorously derived. In particular, this model has energy well at SO(3)(V h ) −1 . We generalize this result to the case of a family of energy densities for materials with spontaneous stretches and with in-plane variation of the associated spontaneous strain, namely, with a x -dependent D. Note that these densities may possible be not representable in the form (1.5), as is the case, for example, of thin gel sheets (see Remark 5.1). In the literature of prestrained materials, (V h ) −1 is typically a smooth, invertible tensor field which represents an active stretch, growth, plasticity or other inelastic phenomena. 3D models of the form (1.5) with V h = I 3 + hD, where D ∈ L ∞ (Ω, Sym (3)), have been very recently treated in [12] and [25] for deriving corresponding rod models with misfit.

Without any attempt of being complete, let us mention that other important contributions on the mathematics of prestrained elastic films are [10,26,28,29,30]. In particular, in [28] the (physical) growth tensor (V h ) −1 is of the form I 3 + h γ S(z ) + h γ/2 z 3 D(z ), z ∈ Ω h , with γ ∈ (0, 2), and corresponding reduced models are derived for the sequence of physical energies E h scaled by h (γ+3) .

At the same time, the bending regime E h /h 3 has been considered in [10] and [29] for a growth tensors depending only on the planar variable. From this point of view, our derivation is new since it accounts for Kirchhoff plate models for materials which admit a (physical) growth tensor of the form (V h (z)) −1 = I 3 + z 3 D(z ) (that can be obtained from the previous expression taken from [28] with γ = 0 and S ≡ 0). We also refer the reader to [27], where the violation of condition (1.4) is considered in connection with the criticality of some scaling exponents. Finally, let us recall the references [1], [2] and [9] where bilayer plate models are considered. In [9], a numerical treatment for deriving the reduced models is employed.

We conclude this section by introducing some general notation which will be used throughout the paper.

1.1. Notation. For fixed n ∈ N we will denote by • R n×n the vector space of real n × n matrices and by I n ∈ R n×n the identity matrix, Furthermore, we give the following definitions:

•F ∈ R 2×2 is the 2 × 2 submatrix of F ∈ R 3×3 obtained by omitting the last row and the last column of F , • given G ∈ R 2×2 , the matrixĜ ∈ R 3×3 associated to G is defined aŝ
G =   G 0 0 0 0 0   , • L (R 3×3 ) is the space of all linear functions from R 3×3 to R, • L 2 (R 3×3 ) is the space of all bilinear functions from R 3×3 × R 3×3 to R.
Let K be a compact subset of R 3×3 . We say that Φ ∈ C 2 (K) if there exists U ⊆ R 3×3 open, containing K, such that Φ ∈ C 2 (U). We equip C 2 (K) with the norm ||Φ|| C 2 (K) := ||Φ|| C(K) + ||DΦ|| C(K,L (R 3×3 )) + ||D 2 Φ|| C(K,L 2 (R 3×3 )) for every Φ ∈ C 2 (K).

By N (V) we denote the family of all open neighbourhoods of a set V ⊆ R 3×3 .

We denote by {e 1 , e 2 } the standard basis of R 2 and by {f 1 , f 2 , f 3 } the standard basis of R 3 . An open connected subset of R 2 will be called domain. Sometimes, for the sake of brevity, an open subset of R 2 with Lischitz boundary will be called a Lipschitz subset of R 2 . The closure of a set S ⊆ R 2 is denoted by S or by cl(S).


Energy densities for materials with spontaneous strain

Throughout the paper ω ⊆ R 2 will be a simply-connected, bounded domain with Lipschitz boundary satisfying the following condition:

there exists a closed subset Σ ⊂ ∂ω with H 1 (Σ) = 0 such that the outer unit normal exists and is continuous on ∂ω \ Σ.

(2.1)

The requirement that ω is a simply-connected domain has to do with the "compatibility" condition of Theorem 3.5 below, which is imposed on the tensor-valued map D min defined by (2.2) and (2.10). The condition (2.1) is a standard requirement on the domain in order to have some density results for the space of W 2,2 -isometric immersions of ω into R 3 (see, e.g., [21] and [22]). We are interested in a thin sheet Ω h := ω × (−h/2, h/2), with 0 < h 1, of a material characterized by a spontaneous stretch given at each point of Ω h in the form U h (z) = I 3 + hB z , z 3 h , for a suitable spontaneous strain B ∈ L ∞ (Ω, Sym (3)). The stretch U h being spontaneous for the material is modeled by introducing a energy density whose minimum state is precisely U h (z) at each point z, modulo superposed rigid body rotations. We denote by U h the spontaneous stretch given in terms of the rescaled variable x ∈ Ω := Ω 1 . Namely,
U h (x) = U h (x , hx 3 ) so that U h = I 3 + hB.
More in general, we consider a family B = {B h } h≥0 of spontaneous strains such that 
B h → B 0 =: B in L ∞ (Ω, Sym(3)), as h → 0,(2.(i) for a.e. x ∈ Ω, the map W h (x, ·) is frame indifferent, i.e. W h (x, F ) = W h (x, F R) for every F ∈ R 3×3 and every R ∈ SO(3); (ii) for a.e. x ∈ Ω, W h (x, ·) is minimized precisely at SO(3)U h (x); (iii) there exists U ∈ N SO(3) and W ∈ C 2 (U) such that ess sup x∈Ω W h (x, ·) − W C 2 (U ) → 0, as h → 0; (2.4)
(iv) there exists a constant C > 0, independent of h, such that for a.e. x ∈ Ω it holds that
W h (x, F ) ≥ Cdist 2 F, SO(3)U h (x) , for every F ∈ R 3×3 . (2.5)
The most interesting scenarios occur when the Cauchy-Green distribution C h associated with the spontaneous stretch distribution U h − namely, C h (x) := (U h (x)) 2 − is not kinematically compatible, i.e. there is no orientation-preserving deformation v h : Ω → R 3 such that (∇v h ) T ∇v h = C h in Ω. We also recall that, since C h (x) is a positive definite symmetric matrix, the distribution C h can be interpreted as a metric on Ω and that, in this framework, the kinematic compatibility of C h is equivalent to the condition that the Riemann curvature tensor associated with C h vanishes identically in Ω (see [11] and [29]). Given a B-admissible family {W h } h>0 of free-energy densities, with associated limiting density function W , using a standard notation we define the following quadratic form:
Q 3 (F ) := D 2 W (I 3 )[F, F ], for every F ∈ R 3×3 . (2.6)
Moreover, for every G ∈ R 2×2 , we set
Q 2 (G) := min d∈R 3 Q 3 Ĝ + d ⊗ f 3 ,(2.7)
referring to Subsection 1.1 for the notationĜ. Observe that the limiting density W inherits properties (i), (ii) and (iv) from convergence (2.4). From this fact one can deduce that Q 2 is indeed a quadratic form and that Q k , for k = 2, 3, has the following properties:

• Q k is positive semi-definite on R k×k and positive definite when restricted to Sym(k),

• Q k (F ) = 0 for every F ∈ Skew(k),

• Q k is strictly convex on Sym(k).

The proof of some of the listed properties can be found for instance in [10]. We also refer to [13,Proposition 11.9] for a useful characterization of quadratic forms.

Our limiting 2D bending model will be related to the 2D density function Q 2 : ω×R 2×2 → [0, +∞) defined as
Q 2 (x , G) := min D∈R 2×2ˆ1 /2 −1 /2 Q 2 D + tG −B(x , t) dt, (2.8)
for a.e. x ∈ ω and every G ∈ R 2×2 . As can be read off from the previous definition, the limiting density, and in turn the limiting 2D model, will depend on the original 3D model − the B-admissible family {W h } − through the tensor-valued mapB. We refer the reader to Subsection 1.1 for the notationB(x , t) ∈ Sym(2). Since Q 2 does not depend on the skew-symmetric part of its argument, the minimum problem which defines Q 2 can be equivalently given on Sym (2), and that Q 2 (x , G) = Q 2 (x , G sym ). The same minimum problem can be solved explicitly, as stated by the following lemma.

Lemma 2.2. The minimum in (2.8) is attained at´1
/2 −1 /2B (x , t)dt for a.e.
x ∈ ω and all G ∈ Sym (2). In other words, we have that
Q 2 (x , G) =ˆ1 /2 −1 /2 Q 2 ˆ1 /2 −1 /2B (x , t) dt + tG −B(x , t) dt (2.9)
for a.e. x ∈ ω and every G ∈ Sym(2).

Proof. Define D(x ) :=´1 /2 −1 /2B (x , t) dt, for a.e. x ∈ ω. Let L ∈ L 2 (R 2×2 ) be the bilinear form associated with Q 2 . Fix G ∈ Sym(2) and note that for a.e. x ∈ ω we have that min
D∈Sym(2)ˆ1 /2 −1 /2 Q 2 (D + tG −B(x , t)) dt = min D∈Sym(2)ˆ1 /2 −1 /2 Q 2 (D) + Q 2 tG −B(x , t) + 2L D, tG −B(x , t) dt = min D∈Sym(2)ˆ1 /2 −1 /2 Q 2 (D) + Q 2 tG −B(x , t) + 2t L D, G + 2L D, −B(x , t) dt =ˆ1 /2 −1 /2 Q 2 tG −B(x , t) dt + min D∈Sym(2) Q 2 (D) + 2L D, −D(x ) =ˆ1 /2 −1 /2 Q 2 tG −B(x , t) dt − Q 2 D(x ) + min D∈Sym(2) Q 2 D − D(x ) . Therefore, since min D∈Sym(2) Q 2 D − D(x ) = 0 is attained at D = D(x ), for a.e. x ∈ ω, the thesis follows.
For a.e. x ∈ ω and every G ∈ Sym(2), we define
D min (x ) := argmin D∈Sym(2)ˆ1 /2 −1 /2 Q 2 D + tG −B(x , t) dt =ˆ1 /2 −1 /2B (x , t) dt.
(2.10)

Note that D min , which is in principle dependent on G from its definition, turns out to be independent of G in the end. This is not the case when, e.g., the limiting density function W depends explicitly on x 3 , not just through its spontaneous stretch, see [41]. Note also from hypothesis (2.2) that D min ∈ L ∞ (ω, Sym (2)). Finally, observe from (2.9) that one can write Q 2 more explicitly in the form
Q 2 (x , G) = 1 12 Q 2 G − 12ˆ1 /2 −1 /2 tB(x , t) dt +ˆ1 /2 −1 /2 Q 2 B (x , t) dt − Q 2 ˆ1 /2 −1 /2B (x , t) dt − 12Q 2 ˆ1 /2 −1 /2 tB(x , t) dt , (2.11)
for a.e. x ∈ ω and every G ∈ Sym(2). We will better use this expression for Q 2 more than (2.9) when we look for pointwise minimizers in Section 4. In fact, the only relevant part of Q 2 for our minimization purposes is the first summand on the right hand side of (2.11). We conclude this subsection with a technical lemma consisting in two estimates on W h and W that will be used in the proof of the Γ-lim inf and the Γ-lim sup, respectively, in Section 3. They are elementary consequences of properties (ii) and (iii) in the definition of the family {W h }. Lemma 2.3. For every ε > 0 there exists h ε > 0 and C ε > 0 such that for a.e. x ∈ Ω, every F ∈ Br(0) and every h ∈ (0, h ε ] it holds that
W h x, U h (x) + F − W I 3 + F ≤ ε|F | 2 .
(2.12)
W h x, U h (x) + F ≤ C ε |F | 2 . (2.13)
In order to prove the lemma, we introduce two auxiliary functions associated with the limiting density W , which will also be used later on. Lettingr > 0 be such that B 2r (I 3 ) is contained in the neighborhood of SO (3) where W is defined, we define the function ρ 0 :
Br(0) → R by ρ 0 (F ) := W (I 3 + F ) − 1 2 D 2 W (I 3 )[F ] 2 (2.14)
for every F ∈ Br(0). The following property is a direct consequence of the regularity of W :
ρ(s) := sup |F |≤s |ρ 0 (F )| satisfies ρ(s)/s 2 → 0 as s → 0. (2.15) Proof of Lemma 2.3. Fix ε > 0 and choose h ε > 0 such that for a.e. x ∈ Ω, every h ∈ [0, h ε ] and every F ∈ Br(0) we have that U h (x) + F ∈ B 2r (I 3 ). Define G h : Br(0) → [0, +∞) by G h (F ) := W h x, U h (x) + F for every h ∈ (0, h ε ] and G 0 (F ) := W I 3 + F , F ∈ Br(0). Fix F ∈ Br(0) and h ∈ [0, h ε ].
We have the following estimate:
G h (F ) − G 0 (F ) ≤ sup t∈[0,1] DG h (tF )F − DG 0 (tF )F ≤ |F | sup t∈[0,1] DG h (tF ) − DG 0 (tF ) L (R 3×3 ) .
Similarly,
DG h (tF ) − DG 0 (tF ) L (R 3×3 ) ≤ sup s∈[0,1] sup |M |≤1 D 2 G h (stF )[tF, M ] − D 2 G 0 (stF )[tF, M ] ≤ sup Br(0) D 2 G h − D 2 G 0 L 2 (R 3×3 ) |t||F |.
By putting together the above estimates we have (after possibly shrinking h ε ) that (2.12) holds. By using (2.14), (2.15) and the estimate (2.12) we obtain
W h x, U h (x) + F ≤ W I 3 + F + ε|F | 2 ≤ D 2 W I 3 [F ] 2 + ρ(|F |) + ε|F | 2 ,
for a.e. x ∈ Ω, every F ∈ Br(0) and every h ∈ (0, h ε ]. It is now clear, by regularity of W and (2.15) that the right hand side above divided by |F | 2 is bounded by a constant independent of F (after possibly shrinkingr), proving (2.13).


Compactness and Γ-convergence results

In this section we state and prove the compactness and Γ-convergence results which allow us to rigorously derive the corresponding 2D-model. We use the standard notation
∇ y := ∂ 1 y ∂ 2 y and ∇ h y := ∇ y 1 h ∂ 3 y , for y ∈ W 1,2 (Ω, R 3 )
. Given a B-admissible family W h h>0 of energy densities in the sense of Definition 2.1, for every h > 0 we define the rescaled free energy functional E h :
W 1,2 (Ω, R 3 ) → [0, +∞] as E h (y) :=ˆΩ W h x, ∇ h y(x) dx, for every y ∈ W 1,2 (Ω, R 3 ). (3.1)
The following compactness result says in particular that if the rescaled energy E h /h 2 is bounded on y h , uniformly in h, then the sequence {y h } converges to a deformation y which belongs to the class of isometries (y ∈ W 2,2 iso (ω), using the notation introduced below).
Theorem 3.1 (Compactness). Let y h h>0 ⊆ W 1,2 Ω, R 3 be a sequence which satisfies lim sup h→0 1 h 2ˆΩ W h x, ∇ h y(x) dx < +∞. (3.2) Then ∇ h y h h>0 is precompact in L 2 Ω, R 3×3 , that is: there exists a (not relabeled) subsequence such that ∇ h y h → ∇ y ν in L 2 Ω, R 3×3 , where ν(x) = ∂ 1 y(x) ∧ ∂ 2 y(x)
. Moreover, the limit ∇ y ν has the following properties:
(i) ∇ y ν (x) ∈ SO(3) for a.e. x ∈ Ω, (ii) ∇ y ν ∈ W 1,2 Ω, R 3×3 and (iii) ∇ y ν is independent of x 3 .
To prove this compactness result, we can use the same argument as in the proof of the corresponding result in [41]: to obtain that low-energy sequences converge to an isometry, it suffices dealing with a family of densities with associated spontaneous stretches of the form (3)) and α ≥ 1.
I 3 + h α B h (x), with {B h } bounded in L 2 (Ω, Sym
Proof of Theorem 3.1. We will show that the sequence
∇ h y h h>0 ⊆ L 2 Ω, R 3×3 satisfies lim sup h→0 1 h 2ˆΩ dist 2 ∇ h y h (x), SO(3) dx < +∞. (3.3)
The thesis then directly follows by applying Theorem 4.1 from [18].
Fix h > 0 and F ∈ R 3×3 . For a.e. x ∈ Ω there exists R h,F (x) ∈ SO(3) such that dist F, SO(3) I 3 + hB h (x) = F − R h,F (x)(I 3 + hB h x) .
We have the following estimate:
dist 2 (F, SO(3)) ≤ F − R h,F (x) 2 ≤ 2 F − R h,F (x) I 3 + hB h (x) 2 + 2 hR h,F (x)B h (x) 2 ≤ 2 C W h (x, F ) + 6h 2 B h (x) 2 (3.4)
for a.e. x ∈ Ω. By (3.2) and (3.4) we have that (3.3) holds true.

Before proceeding we introduce some notation which will be useful throughout. Given a bounded Lipschitz domain S ⊂ R 2 , the class of the isometries of S into R 3 is denoted by
W 2,2 iso (S, R 3 ) = y ∈ W 2,2 S, R 3 : ∂ 1 y = ∂ 2 y = 1, ∂ 1 y · ∂ 2 y = 0 . (3.5)
For the sake of brevity, we equivalently use the symbol W 2,2 iso (S). We recall that for a given y ∈ W 2,2 ω, R 3 the pull-back of the second fundamental form of y(ω) at the point y(x ) is given by
A y (x ) := (∇ y(x )) T ∇ ν(x ), where ν(x ) := ∂ 1 y(x ) ∧ ∂ 2 y(x ) for a.e. x ∈ ω. (3.6)
As we will see, our 2D limiting bending model will depend on deformations y ∈ W 2,2 iso (ω, R 3 ) through A y . The following density result is proved in [21] and will be used for the construction of the recovery sequence in the proof of the Γ-lim sup convergence result below.
Theorem 3.2. Assume that S ⊆ R 2 is a bounded Lipschitz domain which satisfies (2.1). Then W 2,2 iso (S) ∩ C ∞ (S, R 3 ) is W 2,2 -strongly dense in W 2,2 iso (S).
Before stating the following convergence theorem, let us anticipate that our limiting 2D model will be described by the energy functional E 0 :
W 1,2 (Ω, R 3 ) → [0, +∞] defined as E 0 (y) :=    1 2ˆω Q 2 (x , A y (x )) dx , + ∞, for y ∈ W 2,2 iso (ω), otherwise, (3.7)
where Q 2 is defined through (2.2) and (2.9).

Theorem 3.3 (Γ-limit). The following convergence results hold true:

(i) Γ-lim inf: for every sequence {y h } h>0 and every y such that y h y weakly in
W 1,2 (Ω, R 3 ), it holds E 0 (y) ≤ lim inf h→0 1 h 2 E h (y h ), (ii) Γ-lim sup: under the hypothesis curl curl D min = 0 in W −2,2 ω, Sym(2) , (3.8)
with D min defined by (2.2) and (2.10), we have that for every y ∈ W 1,2 (Ω,
R 3 ) there exists a sequence {y h } h>0 such that y h → y in W 1,2 (Ω, R 3 ), fulfilling E 0 (y) = lim h→0 1 h 2 E h (y h )
. The convergence results of the previous theorem amount to saying that the sequence of energy functionals 1 h 2 E h Γ-converge to E 0 , as h → 0, in the strong and the weak topology of W 1,2 (Ω, R 3 ). The operator curl inside the parenthesis in condition (3.8) acts on a 2×2 matrix by taking the curl of each row, giving as a result a two-dimensional vector. We postpone the proof of the theorem after the following example.

Example 3.4. Note that when D min is constant, condition (3.8) is trivially satisfied. In particular, recalling definition (2.10), condition (3.8) is trivially satisfied whenever the map x →B is constant in x . At the same time, the same condition is satisfied with D min ≡ 0 by every map x →B(x) which is nothing but odd in x 3 . We also note that it is possible to realize D min ≡ C = 0 through a map x →B(x) which is not constant in x . To construct such an example, one can fix B m ∈ Sym(2) \ {0} and defineB
(x) := N i=1B i (x 3 )χ ω i (x ), for a.e. x ∈ Ω, where {ω i } N i=1 is a partition of ω and {B i } N i=1 ⊆ L ∞ (−1/2, 1/2), R 3×3 is a family of functions satisfyingˆ1 /2 −1 /2B i (x 3 ) dx 3 = B m ,
for every i = 1, . . . , N, and such thatB i (x 3 ) =B j (x 3 ) for every i = j and every x 3 . This gives rise to aB which is piecewise constant in x (but not constant in the same variable), and in turn to
D min (x ) = N i=1 χ ω i (x )ˆ1 /2 −1 /2B i (t) dt = B m .
Note also that the above defined mapB can give rise to a non-constant tensor valued map x →´1 /2 −1 /2 tB(x , t) dt, which is interpreted in Section 4 (in each point x ) as the target curvature tensor which appears in the 2D limiting model. Indeed, in the case of N = 2, by choosingB 1 (x 3 ) := (x 3 + 1)I 2 andB 2 (x 3 ) := (x 3 3 + 1)I 2 for all x 3 ∈ (−1/2, 1/2), we obtain a simple example ofB for which D min is constant, while the tensor-valued map x →´1
/2 −1 /2 tB(x , t) dt is piecewise constant.
The proof of the Γ-lim inf is a straightforward adaptation to the case of a family of energy densities {W h } with wells SO(3) I 3 + hB h , of the corresponding result in [18] pertaining the case of a homogeneous W (minimized at SO (3)). For the construction of the recovery sequence in the proof of the Γ-lim sup one has instead to add an additional term with respect to the classical construction (see the third summand on the right-hand side of (3.11)). Such additional term gives rise, in the limit as h → 0, to a symmetrized gradient (see formula (3.12)), in a position where the map D min should appear in order to match the Γ-limit (cfr. (2.8) and (3.7)). For this purpose, condition (3.8) guarantees that the map D min is a symmetrized gradient, thanks to Theorem 3.5. Throughout the following proof C is a generic positive constant, varying form line to line and independent of all other quantities.
Proof of Theorem 3.3. (i) Γ-lim inf: Let y ∈ W 1,2 (Ω, R 3 ) and {y h } be such that y h y weakly in W 1,2 (Ω, R 3 ). Assume that lim inf h→0 E h y h /h 2 < +∞,
otherwise the proof is trivial. Then, as shown in [18] and up to a (not relabeled) subsequence, there exists a family of piecewise constant
maps R h : Q h → SO(3) such that Q h ×(−1/2,1/2) ∇ h y h (x) − R h (x ) 2 dx ≤ Ch 2 ,(3.9)
and
R h → (∇ y|ν) in L 2 (Ω, R 3 ) as h → 0, where Q h := Q a,3h
⊆ω Q a,h and Q a,h := a + (−1/2, 1/2) 2 for every h > 0 and a ∈ hZ 2 . Moreover, the sequence G h : Ω → R 3×3 defined by
G h (x , x 3 ) :=    R h (x ) T ∇ h y h (x , x 3 ) − I 3 h 0 for x ∈ Q h × (−1/2, 1/2), elswhere in Ω, (3.10) converges weakly in L 2 (Ω, R 3×3 ), as h → 0, to some G ∈ L 2 (Ω, R 3×3 ) such thať G(x) =Ǧ(x , 0) + x 3 A y (x ), for a.e. x ∈ Ω.
Letting χ h be the characteristic function of the set
Q h ∩ |G h (x)| ≤ 1/ √ h we also have that χ h G h G in L 2 (Ω, R 3×3 ) as h → 0. Now, denote A h (x) := G h (x) − B h (x) for a.e.
x ∈ Ω and every h > 0. Note that
A h G − B in L 2 (Ω, R 3×3 ) and hA h L ∞ Q h ∩{|G h (x)|≤1/ √ h} → 0.
By using frame indifference of W h , (2.15) and the estimate (2.12) from Lemma 2.3, we have that for a fixed ε > 0, there existsh > 0 such that the following estimates hold for every h ∈ (0,h):
1 h 2ˆΩ W h (x, ∇ h y h (x)) dx ≥ 1 h 2ˆΩ χ h W h (x, R h (x ) T ∇ h y h (x)) dx = 1 h 2ˆΩ χ h W h x, I 3 + hB h (x) + hA h (x) dx ≥ 1 h 2ˆΩ χ h 1 2 D 2 W (I 3 ) hA h (x) 2 − χ h ε|hA h (x)| 2 + χ h ρ 0 hA h (x) dx ≥ˆΩ χ h 1 2 Q 3 A h (x) − χ h ε|A h (x)| 2 − χ h ρ hA h (x) |hA h (x)| 2 |A h (x)| 2 dx,
where ρ 0 and ρ are defined by (2.14) and (2.15), respectively. Since Q 3 is lower semicontinuous in the weak topology of L 2 (Ω, R 3×3 ), passing to lim inf as h → 0 in the above inequality we obtain
lim inf h→0 1 h 2ˆΩ W h (x, ∇ h y h (x)) dx ≥ˆΩ 1 2 Q 3 G(x) − B(x) dx − Cε, where C > 0 is such that ||A h || L 2 (Ω,R 3×3 ) ≤ C.
Finally, by letting ε → 0 and by using the fact that
Q 3 (F ) ≥ Q 2 (F ) for every F ∈ R 3×3 we get that lim inf h→0 1 h 2ˆΩ W h (x, ∇ h y h (x)) dx ≥ 1 2ˆΩ Q 2 Ǧ (x , 0) + x 3 A y (x ) −B(x , x 3 ) dx ≥ 1 2ˆω Q 2 x , A y (x ) dx ,
which proves Γ-lim inf inequality.

(ii) Γ-lim sup: Let us prove Γ-lim sup inequality for a given y ∈ W 2,2 iso,0 (ω) := W 2,2 iso (ω)∩C ∞ (ω, R 3 ). Once we have proved it, Γ-lim sup inequality will follow for any y ∈ W 2,2 iso (ω) by the density result of Theorem 3.2 and the continuity of the limiting functional E 0 with respect to W 2,2 convergence. Suppose that E 0 (y) < +∞ (otherwise the proof is trivial). Let d ∈ C ∞ c (Ω, R 3 ) and define D : Ω → R 3 by
D(x , x 3 ) :=ˆx 3 0 d(x , t) dt, for every (x , x 3 ) ∈ ω × (−1/2, 1/2) = Ω. Letg := (g 1 ,g 2 ) ∈ C ∞ c (R 2 , R 2 )
. We consider the family of functions y h of the form
y h (x) := y(x ) + h x 3 ν(x ) + ∇ y(x )g(x ) + h 2 D(x , x 3 ),(3.11)
for every x ∈ Ω and every h > 0, whose (h-rescaled) gradient ∇ h y h reads as
∇ h y h (x) = (∇ y(x ) ν(x )) + h ∇ x 3 ν(x ) + ∇ y(x )g(x ) d(x) + h 2 ∇ D(x) 0 ,
for every x ∈ Ω and every h > 0, One can easily verify that, in particular, {y h } h>0 ⊆ W 2,∞ (Ω, R 3 ) and that it converges in W 1,2 to y, as h → 0. Denote by R(x ) := ∇ y(x ) ν(x ) for every x ∈ ω. Set
C h (x) := R T (x ) ∇ x 3 ν(x ) + ∇ y(x )g(x ) d(x) + h ∇ D(x) 0 − B h (x)
, for a.e. x ∈ Ω, and note that C h converges in L ∞ (Ω, R 3×3 ) to the function
Ω x → R T (x ) ∇ x 3 ν(x ) + ∇ y(x )g(x ) d(x) − B(x) ∈ R 3×3 .
With this notation, we have that 
R T (x )∇ h y h (x) = U h (x) + hC h (x)1 h 2 W h x, ∇ h y h (x) = 1 h 2 W h x, R T (x )∇ h y h (x) = 1 h 2 W h x, U h (x) + hC h (x) ≤ C,
for a.e. x ∈ Ω and every 0 < h ≤ h. Moreover,
1 h 2 W h x, ∇ h y h (x) → 1 2 Q 3 R T (x ) ∇ x 3 ν(x ) + ∇ y(x )g(x ) d(x) − B(x)
pointwise almost everywhere in Ω, as h → 0. Then, by applying dominated convergence theorem we get that
1 h 2ˆΩ W h x, ∇ h y h (x) dx → 1 2ˆΩ Q 3 R T (x ) ∇ x 3 ν(x ) + ∇ y(x )g(x ) d(x) − B(x) dx
as h → 0. In order to have the right hand side above in terms of quadratic form Q 2 , let us first observe that the 2 × 2 matrix obtained of
R T (x ) x 3 ∇ ν(x ) + ∇ ∇ y(x )g(x ) d(x)
by deleting its third row and third column, equals
x 3 A y (x ) + ∇ y(x ) T ∇ ∇ y(x )g(x )
for all

x ∈ ω, by definition of R(x ). We can write the second summand above more explicitly: by using that
∇ y(x )g(x ) = ∂ 1 y(x )g 1 (x ) + ∂ 2 y(x )g 2 (x ), ∇ ∇ y(x )g(x ) = ∂ 1 ∂ 1 y(x )g 1 ∂ 2 ∂ 1 y(x )g 2 + ∂ 1 ∂ 2 y(x )g 1 ∂ 2 ∂ 2 y(x )g 2 + ∇ y(x )∇ g(x )
and that ∂ i y · ∂ j y = δ ij and ∂ i ∂ j y · ∂ k y = 0 for every i, j, k = 1, 2 (since y ∈ W 2,2 iso,0 (ω)), we get
∇ y(x ) T ∇ ∇ y(x )g(x ) = ∂ 1 y(x ) ∂ 2 y(x ) T ∇ ∇ y(x )g(x ) = ∇ g(x ).
Observe also that the map d min : Ω → R 3 defined by
d min (x , x 3 ) := argmin c∈R 3 Q 3 R T (x ) ∇ x 3 ν(x ) + ∇ y(x )g(x ) c − B(x)
belongs to L 2 (Ω, R 3 ). Indeed, this can be easily seen since E 0 (y) < +∞ and since there exists C > 0 such that
E 0 (y) =ˆωˆ1 /2 −1 /2 Q 2 D min (x ) + tA y (x ) −B(x , t) dt dx ≥ˆωˆ1 /2 −1 /2 C D min (x ) + tA y (x ) − B(x , t) ˆ+ d min (x) ⊗ f 3 2 dt dx .
By definition of Q 2 we have that
Ω Q 3 R T (x ) ∇ x 3 ν(x ) + ∇ y(x )g(x ) d min (x) − B(x) dx =ˆΩ Q 2 x 3 A y (x ) + ∇ symg (x ) −B(x) dx.
The density of C ∞ c (Ω, R 3 ) in L 2 (Ω, R 3 ) and a diagonal argument give us that lim sup
h→0 1 h 2ˆΩ W h (x, ∇ h y h (x)) dx =ˆω 1 2ˆ1 /2 −1 /2 Q 2 x 3 A y (x )+∇ symg (x )−B(x , x 3 ) dx 3 dx . (3.12)
Finally, the compatibility assumption (3.8) on D min and Theorem 3.5 guarantee the existence of the map w ∈ W 1,2 (ω, R 2 ) such that D min (x ) = ∇ sym w(x ) for a.e. x ∈ ω. Thus, by using the density of C ∞ c (R 2 , R 2 ) (when restricted to ω) in W 1,2 (ω, R 2 ) and a diagonal argument one more time, we prove Γ-lim sup inequality for a given y ∈ W 2,2 iso,0 (ω). The following result is used in the proof of the Γ-lim sup. It can be found in [32] and has to do with the so-called Saint-Venant compatibility condition in L p .

Theorem 3.5. Let S ⊆ R 2 be a simply-connected bounded domain with Lipschitz boundary. Let p ∈ (1, +∞) and A ∈ L p (S, Sym (2)). Then curl curl A = 0 in W −2,p (S, Sym (2)) ⇐⇒ A = ∇ sym w for some w ∈ W 1,p (S, R 2 ). (3.13) Moreover w is unique up to rigid displacements.

Remark 3.6. By standard arguments of Γ-convergence it can be shown that the above analysis holds also in the case when the appropriate body forces are present. More precisely, the above results can be applied to the sequence of functionals {F h } h>0 defined by
F h (y) = E h (y) −ˆΩ f h (x) · y(x) dx, for every y ∈ W 1,2 (Ω, R 3 ), where {f h } h≥0 ⊆ L 2 (Ω, R 3 )
is the family of body forces such that
f h h 2 f 0 weakly in L 2 (Ω, R 3 ) andˆΩ f h (x) dx = 0 for every h ≥ 0. The sequence {F h } Γ−converges, as h → 0, to F 0 (y) :=    E 0 (y) −ˆω f (x ) · y(x ) dx , + ∞, for y ∈ W 2,2 iso (ω), otherwise. where f (x ) :=´1 /2 −1 /2 f 0 (x , t) dt for a.e. x ∈ ω.

Energy minimizers

4.1. x -dependent target curvature tensor A and pointwise minimizers. In this section, we discuss the minimizers of the derived 2D model in some special cases. Recall that the 2D limiting energy functional E 0 is given by
E 0 (y) =    1 2ˆω Q 2 x , A y (x ) dx , + ∞, for y ∈ W 2,2 iso (ω), otherwise,
where W 2,2 iso (ω) is the set of W 2,2 -isometric immersions of ω into R 3 , defined by (3.5). From formula (2.11), we have that
E 0 (y) = 1 24ˆω Q 2 A y (x ) − 12ˆ1 /2 −1 /2 tB(x , t) dt dx + ad.t. (4.1)
for every y ∈ W 2,2 iso (ω), where ad.t. stays for "additional terms" (not depending on y). Recall that A y is the pull-back of the second fundamental form associated with y(ω) (see (3.6)), hence it gives information on the curvature realized by the deformation y. On the other hand, when reading the expression for E 0 , it is natural to define the target curvature tensor
A(x ) := 12ˆ1 /2 −1 /2 tB(x , t) dt, for a.e. x ∈ ω,(4.2)
which encodes the spontaneous curvature of the system. While, for a.e. x , the tensor A(x ) (which depends onB and in turn on the family of spontaneous strains {B h }, see formula (2.2)) is a given 2×2 symmetric matrix with possibly nonzero determinat, it is a well known result of differential geometry that every smooth y ∈ W 2,2 iso (ω) satisfies det A y = 0 in ω. From [35, Lemma 2.5], one can deduce that the same property holds for any arbitrary y ∈ W 2,2 iso (ω), a.e. in ω. Our aim is to determine explicitly some classes of minimizers. More precisely, introducing the notation
F := F ∈ Sym(2) : det F = 0 ,(4.3)
and having in mind the inequality
min W 2,2 iso (ω) E 0 ≥ 1 24ˆω min F ∈F Q 2 F − A(x ) dx + ad.t.,
we will focus our attention on pointwise minimizers of E 0 . Namely, on those y ∈ W 2,2 iso (ω) such that
E 0 (y) = 1 24ˆω min F ∈F Q 2 F − A(x ) dx + ad.t. = min W 2,2 iso (ω) E 0 . (4.4)
To go on, let us consider the set
N (x ) := argmin F ∈F Q 2 F − A(x ) ,(4.5)
for a.e. x ∈ ω. Note that N (x ) = Ø for a.e. x ∈ ω, because Q 2 is a positive definite quadratic form (when restricted to Sym(2)) and F is a closed subset of Sym(2). To accomplish our program, we would like to have some explicit representation of the elements of N (x ), for a.e. x ∈ ω, also in view of the application which motivates our analysis (see Section 5.). Therefore, we restrict our attention to case of W isotropic, i.e. such that W (RF P ) = W (F ), for every F ∈ R 3×3 and every R, P ∈ SO(3).

This implies the existence of constants λ ∈ R and µ > 0, called Lamé moduli, such that
Q 3 (F ) := D 2 W (I 3 )[F, F ] = 2µ|F sym | 2 + λ tr 2 F,
for every F ∈ R 3×3 (see [20]). In turn, from this expression one can easily show that
Q 2 (F ) := min d∈R 3 Q 3 F + d ⊗ f 3 = 2µ |F sym | 2 + β tr 2 F , for every F ∈ R 2×2 ,(4.6)
where β has the expression
β = λ 2µ + λ . (4.7)
Since Q 2 is positive definite from its very definition, it must be β > −1/2. This bound for β guarantees in particular that the quantities appearing in the statement of Lemma 4.1 below are well defined, and will be used in its proof.

Note that in the case when A is constant in ω, pointwise minimizers of E 0 always exist. More precisely, as noticed in [40] (see Lemma 4.3 below), any minimizer y of E 0 with A constant is characterized by the property A y (x ) ≡ const. ∈ N for a.e. x ∈ ω, where
N := argmin F ∈F Q 2 F − A .
Clearly, in the case of nonconstant A, this is not always true. Now, while the analysis of the minimizers of E 0 , with an arbitrary nonconstant A, is behind the scope of the present paper, it is natural in our context to try to understand under which conditions the existence of pointwise minimizers of E 0 is guaranteed. In Subsection 4.2 we answer this question in the case when A is piecewise constant. To do this, we need a structure result for the set N in the case of constant A. This is the content of the following lemma.

Lemma 4.1. Let a and b be two real numbers and let β be given by (4.7). The following implications hold:
(i) If A = a 0 0 a then N = ρ T r 0 0 0 ρ : ρ ∈ SO(2) with r = a 1+2β 1+β . (ii) If A = a 0 0 −a then N = r 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 −r with r = a 1+β . (iii) If A = a 0 0 b , |a| > |b| then N = r 0 0 0 with r = a + bβ 1+β . (iv) If A = a 0 0 b , |b| > |a| then N = 0 0 0 r with r = b + aβ 1+β .
Before giving the proof of the above statement, let us make a couple of comments. First, note that the lemma, though restricted to the case of A diagonal, covers all the interesting cases, from the simple observation that, with abuse of notation, N A =ρ N Dρ T , whereρ ∈ Orth(2) is such that ρ T Aρ coincides with the diagonal matrix D. Moreover, interpreting the elements of N as second fundamental forms of cylinders (see the discussion below), the parameter r, when different from zero, corresponds to the nonzero principal curvature. In this case, observe also that, with abuse of notation, the set N (ii) is never a subset of N (i) and that, as for the (two) elements of N (ii) , the elements of N (i) are pairwise linearly independent. This can be easily read off from the simple fact that N (i) = r n ⊗ n : n ∈ R 2 with |n| = 1 .

Finally, the set of the directions corresponding to ±r in the cases (i), (ii), (iii), and (iv) is given by {ρ e 1 : ρ ∈ SO(2)}, {e 1 , e 2 }, {e 1 }, {e 2 }, respectively. This fact can be interpreted saying that, in order to reduce the energy, while in case (i) rolling up along all the possible directions is equally favorable, in the remaining cases the system rolls up along the direction corresponding to the greater (in modulus) eigenvalue of the target curvature tensor A.

Proof of Lemma 4.1. Let a, b ∈ R and let A = diag(a, b). By representing any F ∈ Sym(2) by ξ ζ ζ υ , ζ, ξ, υ ∈ R and recalling that Q 2 is of the form (4.6), the minimization problem to be solved is:
min F ∈F F − A 2 + β tr 2 F − A = min (ξ,υ)∈R 2 , ζ∈R ξυ=ζ 2 ξ − a ζ ζ υ − b 2 + β tr 2 ξ − a ζ ζ υ − b
Denote P := (ξ, υ) ∈ R 2 ξυ ≥ 0 and define for every (ξ, υ) ∈ P the function
f (ξ, υ) := (1 + β)(ξ + υ) 2 − 2 a(1 + β) + bβ ξ − 2 b(1 + β) + aβ υ + a 2 + b 2 + β(a + b) 2 ,
so that the minimization problem becomes min (ξ,υ)∈P f (ξ, υ). Let us consider first the case when a = b. Observe that in this case f attains its minimum on ∂P = (ξ, υ) ∈ R 2 | ξυ = 0 . Indeed, supposing by contradiction that the minimum is attained at a point (ξ,ῡ) ∈ int(P ) = (ξ, υ) ∈ R 2 : ξυ > 0 would give
∂ ξ f (ξ,ῡ) = 2(1 + β)(ξ +ῡ) − 2 a(1 + β) + βb = 0, ∂ υ f (ξ,ῡ) = 2(1 + β)(ξ +ῡ) − 2 b(1 + β) + βa = 0,
and in turn a = b, leading to a contradiction. Now (ii), (iii) and (iv) follow by straightforward computations. To prove (i), we first note that the set of stationary points of f in int(P ) is given by
η ± ζ , η ∓ ζ ∈ R 2 : ζ ∈ − |r| 2 , |r| 2 \ {0} , where r = a(1 + 2β) (1 + β) and η ± ζ := r 2 ± r 2 − 4ζ 2 2 , for every ζ ∈ − |r| 2 , |r| 2 \ {0}.
Moreover, the value of f at these stationary points is
f (η + ζ , η − ζ ) = f (η − ζ , η + ζ ) = ar.
At the same time, we have that argmin (ξ,υ)∈∂P f (ξ, υ) = (r, 0), (0, r) , and that f (r, 0) = f (0, r) = ar. Hence,
argmin (ξ,υ)∈P f (ξ, υ) = η ± ζ , η ∓ ζ ∈ R 2 : ζ ∈ − |r| 2 , |r| 2 .
In turn, the elements of N are all the matrices of the form
F ± ζ := η ± ζ ζ ζ η ∓ ζ with |ζ| ≤ |r| 2 .
The proof of the lemma, point (i), can be finished by observing that the following identity holds
ρ T r 0 0 0 ρ : ρ ∈ SO(2) = F ± ζ : |ζ| ≤ |r| 2 .
To conclude the section, we give some definitions which will be useful later on. They regard the sub-class of W 2,2 iso (ω) consisting of cylinders. Given r ∈ (0, +∞], we define the map C r :
R 2 → R 3 as C r (x ) :=    r cos(x 1 /r) − 1 , r sin(x 1 /r), x 2 T , r ∈ (0, +∞), 0, x 1 , x 2 T , r = +∞,
for every x = (x 1 , x 2 ) ∈ R 2 . Then we define the family of maps (3), R ∈ SO(3) and ρ ∈ Orth(2) (4.8)
Cyl := T v • R • C r • ρ : R 2 → R 3 r ∈ (0, +∞], T v ∈ Trs
and we call its elements cylinders. Note that the above defined family of cylinders includes also planes -the elements of Cyl with r = +∞.


Remark 4.2.

Observe that any cylinder y = T v • R • C r • ρ maps lines parallel to ρ T e 2 to the lines of zero curvature -rulings. More in general, direct computations give
∇y(x ) = R ∇C r ρ(x ) ρ = R     − sin x ·ρ T e 1 r 0 cos x ·ρ T e 1 r 0 0 1     ρ,
for all x ∈ R 2 , (4.9)

so that
∇y(λρ T e 2 ) = R   0 0 1 0 0 1   ρ, for every λ ∈ R.
By direct computations one can see that a map y = T • R • C r • ρ ∈ Cyl is an isometry whose second fundamental form is given by
A y (x ) = (detρ) ρ T 1 r 0 0 0 ρ, for every x ∈ R 2 . (4.10)
Now, let us go back to the set F defined in (4.3). From (4.10) and from the simple observation that F can be equivalently represented as
F = R n ⊗ n : n ∈ R 2 with |n| = 1 = R ρ T 1 0 0 0 ρ : ρ ∈ SO(2) ,
one can prove that the set F coincides with the set of (constant) second fundamental forms of cylinders. This fact can in turn be used to show, in the case where the target curvature tensor A is constant, that if y ∈ W 2,2 iso (ω) is a minimizer of E 0 , then y is a pointwise minimizer. This is the first step of the proof of Lemma 4.3 below. The second part of the proof consists then in showing that A y (x ) ∈ N for a.e. x ∈ ω =⇒ A y ≡ const.. (4.11) This property is at the core of our investigations in the following subsection and can be proved using some fine properties of isometric immersions ( [40] and [41]). 2)) and let y ∈ W 2,2 iso (ω) be a minimizer of E 0 . Then y = v| ω for some v ∈ Cyl. In particular, y has constant second fundamental form.


4.2.

The case of piecewise constant A. In this subsection, we consider the case where the target curvature is a piecewise constant tensor valued map x → A(x ). More precisely, given n ∈ N, n ≥ 2, we say that the map A ∈ L ∞ ω, R 2×2 is piecewise constant if it is of the form
A = n k=1 A k χ ω k a.e. in ω, with A k = a k 0 0 b k , a k , b k ∈ R, (4.12)
where {ω k } n k=1 is a partition of ω made of Lipschitz subdomains ω k (see Definition 4.4 below). Clearly, it is convenient distinguishing between two different neighboring subdomain only when the corresponding spontaneous curvature are different from each other. Namely, we suppose that A k = A j for every k = j such that ∂ω j ∩ ∂ω k = Ø. With such target curvature, our 2D energy functional takes the form
E 0 (y) = 1 24 n k=1ˆω k Q 2 A y (x ) − A k dx + ad.t.,
for every y ∈ W 2,2 iso (ω).

We want to determine the conditions the map x → A(x ) has to satisfy in order to guarantee the existence of pointwise minimizers of E 0 , i.e. to guarantee that there exists y ∈ W 2,2 iso (ω) such that A y (x ) ∈ N (x ) for a.e. x ∈ ω, where N (x ) is defined by (4.5). In view of (4.12), we equivalently look for conditions such that there exists y ∈ W 2,2 iso (ω) such that A y (x ) ∈ N k for a.e. x ∈ ω k , for all k = 1, . . . , n, (4.13) where
N k := argmin F ∈F Q 2 F − A k ,
for every k = 1, . . . , n.

(4.14)

Note from (4.11) that a deformation satisfying (4.13) is, roughly speaking, a "patchwork" of cylinders. Therefore, conditions on A guaranteeing (4.13) translates into conditions under which cylinders can be patched together resulting into an isometry. Remark 4.5. Since each ω k is a Lipschitz domain, one has that its boundary ∂ω k has null L 2measure. In particular, we deduce that L 2 ω \ n k=1 ω k = 0.

Given a piecewise constant A and referring to Lemma 4.1 (see also the discussion after its statement), we set
r k :=                        a k (1 + 2β) 1 + β , if b k = a k , a k 1 + β , if b k = −a k , a k + b k β 1 + β , if |a k | > |b k |, b k + a k β 1 + β , if |b k | > |a k |,
for every k = 1, . . . , n. Theorem 4.6. Let A be of the form (4.12). Assume that r k = r j for all 1 ≤ k < j ≤ n such that H 1 ∂ω k ∩ ∂ω j > 0. Then there exists a pointwise minimizer y ∈ W 2,2 iso (ω) of E 0 if and only if the following conditions are satisfied:

(a) [γ k ] is a line segment with γ k (0), γ k (1) ∈ ∂ω, for every k = 1, . . . , n − 1; (b) γ k (0, 1) ∩ γ j (0, 1) = Ø for all k = j = 1, . . . , n − 1; (c) every non flat region ω k , i.e. ω k with corresponding r k = 0, satisfies: ∂ω k ∩ω consists of connected components which are orthogonal to some eigenvector (principal curvature direction) of the matrices of N k corresponding to r k .

Observe that point (c) above implies that for every k and j such that ω k and ω j are neighbor (i.e. share a piece of boundary, in symbols H 1 (∂ω k ∩ ∂ω j ) > 0) it cannot be that A k is of type (iii) (see Lemma 4.1) and A j is of type (iv) at the same time. This is because, if not so, from point (c) above it would follow that the line segment [γ] = ∂ω k ∩ ∂ω j is simultaneously parallel to e 2 and to e 1 , which is absurd. Hence, a reference domain endowed with target curvature as in Figure 3 does not admit a pointwise minimizer.

We also note that if the target curvature does not induce any flat region, the presence of a pointwise minimizer forces the subdivision lines [γ k ] to be all parallel (see Figure 2). When instead a flat region is present in the subdivision, this can give rise to a pointwise minimizer, even if the [γ k ] are not mutually parallel (see Figure 1). Finally, observe that in this case a subdomain of type (iii) and (iv) can coexist (tough they cannot be neighbors).

We conclude this discussion with the following remark regarding the condition r k = r j in the statement of the above theorem.

Remark 4.7. Let k and j be such that H(∂ω k ∩ ∂ω j ) > 0. Observe that when r k = r j (this may happen, though A k = A j ), this condition does not impose that [γ] is a line segment. Indeed, when r k = r j , a pointwise minimizer y, when restricted to ω k and ω j , will be given by the same cylinder restricted to ω k and ω j , respectively, and this fact does not impose any further conditions on ∂ω k ∩ ∂ω j .

We remark that, more in general, the very fact that y is a W 2,2 -isometry is sufficient to deduce that ω consists, up to a null set, of finitely many subdomains (touching each other on a finite union of line segments) on which y is either a plane, or a cylinder, or a cone or "tangent developable". This description can be obtained as a consequence of some fine properties of the class W 2,2 iso (ω) -see [35] for ω convex and [21], [22] for a more general ω. In what follows, we provide a self-contained proof of Theorem 4.6, which exploits the simplifications deriving from our specific setting (see Lemma 4.8 and Remark 4.9 on which the proof of Theorem 4.6 is based). Namely, from the fact that our minimizer is not just an element of W 2,2 iso (ω), but also a "patchwork" of cylinders.

Proof of Theorem 4.6. (Necessity) Suppose that there exists y ∈ W 2,2 iso (ω) pointwise minimizer of E 0 . Equivalently, A y (x ) ∈ N k for a.e. x ∈ ω k and every k = 1, . . . , n. By (4.11) and Lemma 4.1, for every k = 1, . . . , n there exists y k ∈ Cyl, y k = T v k • R k • C 1/|r k | • ρ k , with r k given by (4.15), such that y| ω k = y k and A y k ≡ (det ρ k ) ρ T k diag |r k |, 0 ρ k ∈ N k . Let us show that y = n k=1 χ ω k y k ∈ W 2,2 iso (ω) =⇒ (a), (b) and (c) are satisfied. (4.16) We argue by induction. In the base case, n = 2, the implication (4.16) holds by Lemma 4.11 below. Suppose that (4.16) holds for every m = 2, . . . , n and let us show the same for n + 1. By applying the inductive hypothesis with m = n to {ω k } n+1 k=2 , the Lipschitz n-subdivision of ω 2 , we deduce that γ 2 , . . . , γ n and ω 2 , . . . , ω n+1 satisfy the conditions (a), (b) and (c). Now, consider [γ 1 ] = (∂ω 1 ∩ ∂ω 2 ) (∂ω 1 ∩ ∂ω 3 ). We aim to show that [γ 2 ] ∩ γ 1 (0, 1) = Ø. As a consequence, we would have that one of the sets ∂ω 1 ∩∂ω 2 ∩ω or ∂ω 1 ∩∂ω 3 ∩ω is empty. Then, either [γ 1 ] = ∂ω 1 ∩∂ω 2 and we prove necessity of conditions (a), (b) and (c) by applying the inductive hypothesis with m = 2 to the subdivision {ω 1 , ω 2 } of ω 1 ∪ ω 2 ; or [γ 1 ] = ∂ω 1 ∩ ∂ω 3 and the necessity of the conditions (a), (b) and (c) follows by applying the inductive hypothesis with m = n to the subdivision {ω 1 , ω 3 , . . . , ω n+1 } of ω 1 ∪ ω 3 .

Hence let us prove that [γ 2 ] ∩ γ 1 (0, 1) = Ø. We argue by contradiction following steps 1, 2 and 3 bellow.

Step 1. Suppose by contradiction that [γ 2 ] ∩ γ 1 (0, 1) = Ø. Then [γ 2 ] intersects γ 1 (0, 1) in at most two points. We first exclude the possibility that both γ 2 (0) and γ 2 (1) belong to γ 1 (0, 1) : suppose that both γ 2 (0), γ 2 (1) ∈ γ 1 (0, 1) and note that only one of the sets ∂ω 1 ∩ ∂ω 2 ∩ ω, ∂ω 1 ∩ ∂ω 3 ∩ ω is connected. If ∂ω 1 ∩ ∂ω 2 ∩ ω is connected, by applying the inductive hypothesis with m = 2 to the subdivision {ω 1 , ω 2 } (with subdivision line ∂ω 1 ∩∂ω 2 ) of the set ω 1 ∪ω 2 , we deduce that ∂ω 1 ∩ ∂ω 2 ∩ ω is a line segment, and hence coincide with [γ 2 ]. This implies that H 1 ([γ 2 ] ∩ ∂ω 2 ) > 0 which is absurd. This conclusion can be obtained also in the other case, when ∂ω 1 ∩ ∂ω 3 ∩ ω is connected, by using the inductive hypothesis with m = n. Hence [γ 2 ] intersects γ 1 (0, 1) in at most one point.

Step 2. Suppose that [γ 2 ] ∩ γ 1 (0, 1) is nonempty. We now apply the inductive hypothesis twice: first, with m = 2, to the subdivision {ω 1 , ω 2 } (with subdivision line ∂ω 1 ∩ ∂ω 2 ) of ω 1 ∪ ω 2 to deduce that ∂ω 1 ∩ ∂ω 2 is a line segment; then with m = n, to the subdivision {ω 1 , ω 3 , . . . , ω n+1 } (with subdivision lines ∂ω 1 ∩ ∂ω 3 , [γ 3 ], . . . , [γ n ]) of ω 1 ∪ ω 3 to deduce that ∂ω 1 ∩ ∂ω 3 is a line segment. In particular, if ω 1 is non flat, we have that [γ 1 ] is a line segment.

Step 3. If ω 1 is a flat region, then ω 2 cannot be flat. Hence ∂ω 1 ∩ ∂ω 2 has to be parallel to [γ 2 ] (applying the inductive hypothesis to the subdivision {ω 1 , ω 2 } as above). This leads to a contradiction, proving that [γ 2 ] ∩ γ 1 (0, 1) = Ø. If instead ω 1 is non flat, then [γ 1 ] is a line segment, as observed in Step 2.. Note that at least one of the domains {ω 2 , . . . , ω n+1 } must be non flat. Therefore, if ω 2 is non flat (if not, one can analogously consider ω 1 ∪ ω 3 and end up with the same conclusion), one can argue as in the previous case to deduce that [γ 1 ] is parallel to [γ 2 ], getting a contradiction and concluding finally that [γ 2 ] ∩ γ 1 (0, 1) = Ø.

(Sufficiency) Let {y k } n k=1 be a family of cylinders
y k = T v k • R k • C 1/|r k | • ρ k such that y k χ ω k + y j χ ω j ∈ W 2,2 iso (ω k ∪ ω j ) whenever H 1 (∂ω k ∩ ∂ω j ) > 0 and A y k ≡ (detρ k )ρ T k diag(|r k |, 0)ρ k ∈ N k ,
where r k is given by (4.15) (the existence of such family is provided by Lemma 4.8 and Remark 4.9). Define y := n k=1 χ ω k y k . By direct computations one can check that y ∈ W 2,2 iso (ω) and it is clearly a minimizer of E 0 , since A y k ∈ N k for every k = 1, . . . , n, proving sufficiency.  . An example of reference domain with given target curvature A = A 1 χ ω 1 + A 2 χ ω 2 which does not allow for a pointwise minimizer y. This is because A 1 of type (iv) forces [γ 1 ] to be parallel to e 1 , while A 2 of type (iii) forces [γ 1 ] to be parallel to e 2 .


An auxiliary result.

Here we prove a result, Lemma 4.8 below, which is the main ingredient for the proof of Theorem 4.6. It gives a "recipe" on how two cylinders can be "patched together". We refer to Remark 4.12 below for the notation and the properties of roto-translations used in this section.

Lemma 4.8. Let ω 1 and ω 2 be a Lipschitz 2-subdivision of ω with [γ] := ∂ω 1 ∩ ∂ω 2 (cfr. Definition 4.4). Let y 1 , y 2 ∈ Cyl, say
y 1 = T v 1 • R 1 • C r 1 • ρ 1 and y 2 = T v 2 • R 2 • C r 2 • ρ 2 , with r 1 , r 2 ∈ (0, +∞)
such that detρ 1 = −detρ 2 whenever r 1 = r 2 . The map defined as y := y 1 χ ω 1 + y 2 χ ω 2 , a.e. in ω, belongs to W 2,2 iso (ω) if and only if the following conditions hold: (i) [γ] is a line segment spanned by some e ∈ R 2 \ {0} ; (ii) ρ T 1 e 2 and ρ T 2 e 2 are parallel to e. This in particular implies that ρ 1 ρ T 2 = diag(σ 1 , σ 2 ), for some σ 1 , σ 2 ∈ {±1}; (iii) Setting w k := ρ k γ(0) − (0, 0) and θ k := (w k · e 1 )/r k , for k = 1, 2, we have
R 1Rθ 1 T R 2Rθ 2 = diag σ 1 σ 2 , σ 1 , σ 2 and v 1 + R 1 C r 1 (w 1 ) = v 2 + R 2 C r 2 (w 2 ). (4.17)
We postpone the proof of this lemma until the end of the section.

Remark 4.9. Observe that the condition "detρ 1 = −detρ 2 whenever r 1 = r 2 " permits to exclude the trivial case where we patch together pieces of the same cylinder (i.e. y 1 = y 2 ). Clearly, this case does not force any condition on [γ]. Moreover, an argument similar to that in the proof of Lemma 4.8 allows to prove necessary and sufficient conditions for having y ∈ W 2,2 iso (ω) of the form y = y 1 χ ω 1 + y 2 χ ω 2 with, say, y 2 affine (using our terminology, a cylinder with r 2 = +∞). In this case, condition (i) remains the same and condition (ii) reduces to ρ T 1 e 2 [γ] (while ρ 2 ∈ Orth(2) can be arbitrarily chosen). Moreover, for a chosen ρ 2 ∈ Orth(2), condition (iii) becomes
(R 1Rθ 1 ) T R 2Rθ 2 =   det(ρ 1 ρ T 2 ) 0 0 0 0 ρ 1 ρ T 2   and v 1 + R 1 C r 1 (w 1 ) = v 2 + R 2 C r 2 (w 2 )
with w k := ρ k γ(0) − (0, 0) and θ k := w k · e 1 /r k . 
1 = T v 1 • R 1 • C r 1 • ρ 1 ∈
Cyl be such that ρ T 1 e 2 is parallel to e. By using Lemma 4.8 we can determine all the possible maps y 2 ∈ Cyl, which patched together with y 1 along [γ] give an W 2,2 -isometry y := y 1 χ ω 1 + y 2 χ ω 2 : for a chosen combination of σ 1 , σ 2 ∈ {±1} let ρ 2 ∈ Orth(2) be such that ρ 1 ρ T 2 = diag(σ 1 , σ 2 ) and let w k := ρ k γ(0) − (0, 0) and θ k := (w k · e 2 )/r k , for k = 1, 2. Set
R 2 := R 1Rθ 1 diag(σ 1 σ 2 , σ 1 , σ 2 )R −θ 2 ∈ SO(3), v 2 := v 1 + R 1 C r 1 (w 1 ) − R 2 C r 2 (w 2 ).
Then the map y 2 := T v 2 • R 2 • C r 2 • ρ 2 is a cylinder that patched together with y 1 gives y = y 1 χ ω 1 + y 2 χ ω 2 ∈ W 2,2 iso (ω). According to the above discussion, given y 1 ∈ Cyl there are four possibilities (corresponding to the four different choices of couples σ 1 , σ 2 ∈ {±1}) for y 2 in order to have y = y 1 χ ω 1 + y 2 χ ω 2 ∈ W 2,2 iso (ω).

Note that in the case where γ(0) = (0, 0) conditions (4.17) reduce to
R T 1 R 2 = diag σ 1 σ 2 , σ 1 , σ 2 and v 1 = v 2 . (4.18)
In this case, given
y 1 = T v 1 • R 1 • C r 1 • ρ 1 ∈ Cyl with ρ T 1 e 2 parallel to [γ]
and letting ρ 2 ∈ Orth(2) be such that ρ 1 ρ T 2 = diag(σ 1 , σ 2 ) for some choice of σ 1 , σ 2 ∈ {±1}, the map y 2 such that y := y 1 χ ω 1 + y 2 χ ω 2 ∈ W 2,2 iso (ω) is given by
y 2 := T v 2 • R 2 • C r 2 • ρ 2 , with T v 2 := T v 1 and R 2 := R 1 • diag(σ 1 σ 2 , σ 1 , σ 2 ).
Before stating the following lemma, given a target curvature tensor A of the form (4.12) for some n ∈ N, we will denote by P k the set of all nonzero principal curvature directions corresponding to elements of N k (see (4.14) and Lemma 4.1), for all k = 1, . . . , n. Namely,
P k ∈ {ρ e 1 : ρ ∈ SO(2)}, {e 1 , e 2 }, {e 1 }, {e 2 } ,
for every k = 1, . . . , n.

Lemma 4.11. Let ω 1 and ω 2 be a Lipschitz 2-subdivision of ω with [γ] := ∂ω 1 ∩ ∂ω 2 (cfr. Definition 4.4). Let A be defined by (4.12) with n = 2. Then there exists a pointwise minimizer of E 0 , namely a W 2,2 -isometry of the form y = y 1 χ ω 1 + y 2 χ ω 2 , with y k ∈ Cyl, such that A y k ∈ N k , k = 1, 2, if and only if the following conditions hold:
(i) [γ] is a line segment;
(ii)γ(0) ⊥ ∈ P k whenever r k = 0, k = 1, 2.

Proof. Suppose that there exists y ∈ W 2,2 iso (ω) that is pointwise minimizer of E 0 . Equivalently, A y (x ) ∈ N k for a.e. x ∈ ω k and k = 1, 2. By (4.11) and Lemma 4.1, there exists y k ∈ Cyl, y k = T v k • R k • C 1/|r k | • ρ k , with r k given by (4.15), such that y| ω k = y k , A y k ≡ (det ρ k ) ρ T k diag |r k |, 0 ρ k ∈ N k and ρ T k e 1 ∈ P k . Hence y = y 1 χ ω 1 + y 2 χ ω 2 ∈ W 2,2 iso (ω). By Lemma 4.8 and Remark 4.9 we immediately get that [γ] must be a line segment and that ρ T k e 2 = (ρ T k e 1 ) ⊥ must be parallel to [γ] (and hence toγ(0)), for each k = 1, 2 such that r k = 0, implying thatγ(0) ⊥ ∈ P k and proving necessity of the conditions (i) and (ii).

To prove sufficiency, let ρ k ∈ Orth be such that (det ρ k )ρ T k diag(|r k |, 0) ρ k ∈ N k and such that ρ T k e 2 γ(0) for k = 1, 2. Denote r k = 1/|r k |, k = 1, 2. Clearly, ρ 1 ρ T 2 = diag(σ 1 , σ 2 ) for some σ 1 , σ 2 ∈ {±1}. Now let y k := T v k • R k • C r k • ρ k be such that condition (iii) of Lemma 4.8 is satisfied. Finally, by Lemma 4.8 we have that y := y 1 χ ω 1 + y 2 χ ω 2 ∈ W 2,2 iso (ω) and since A y k ≡ (det ρ k )ρ T k diag(|r k |, 0) ρ k ∈ N k , it is a pointwise minimizer of E 0 .

Proof of Lemma 4.8. In order to prove the necessity of the conditions (i), (ii) and (iii) we will use the fact that the maps in W 2,2 iso (ω) are of class C 1 -the continuity of the gradient of y will provide us with the condition that, in order to be patched together, the two cylinders y 1 and y 2 must have parallel nonzero principal curvature directions, i.e. ρ T 1 e 2 ρ T 2 e 2 . This fact will further imply that [γ] must be a line segment parallel to the (both) nonzero principal curvature directions.

(Necessity) Here, we show that if the deformation y := y 1 χ ω 1 + y 2 χ ω 2 is in W 2,2 iso (ω), then it complies with conditions (i), (ii) and (iii). First of all, we recall from [34,Proposition 5] that the very condition W 2,2 iso (ω) implies y ∈ C 1 (ω, R 3 ). At the same time, from the specific expression of y we have that ∇y = ∇y k in ω k for k = 1, 2, where
∇y k = R k     − sin x ·ρ T k e 1 r k 0 cos x ·ρ T k e 1 r k 0 0 1     ρ k . (4.19)
This expression says in particular that ∇y is bounded and in turn that y ∈ C 1 (ω, R 3 ). Let us first prove the necessity of the conditions (i), (ii) and (iii) in the case when γ(0) = (0, 0). The continuity of y and ∇y at the point (0, 0) gives, respectively, that v 1 = v 2 (obtained by imposing y 1 (0, 0) = y 2 (0, 0)), and
  0 0 1 0 0 1   ρ 1 ρ T 2 = R T 1 R 2   0 0 1 0 0 1   ⇔ R T 1 R 2 =   det(ρ 1 ρ T 2 ) 0 0 0 0 ρ 1 ρ T 2   (4.20)
(obtained from ∇y 1 (0, 0) = ∇y 2 (0, 0) and from expression (4.19)). The continuity of ∇y gives also that ∇y 1 (γ(t)) = ∇y 2 (γ(t)) for each t ∈ [0, 1], that is
    − sin γ(t)·ρ T 1 e 1 r 1 0 cos γ(t)·ρ T 1 e 1 r 1 0 0 1     ρ 1 ρ T 2 = R T 1 R 2     − sin γ(t)·ρ T 2 e 1 r 2 0 cos γ(t)·ρ T 2 e 1 r 2 0 0 1     .
In turn, using the second condition in (4.20) and the notation ρ
1 ρ T 2 = m 1 m 2 m 3 m 4 , we have       −m 1 sin γ(t)·ρ T 1 e 1 r 1 −m 2 sin γ(t)·ρ T 1 e 1 r 1 m 1 cos γ(t)·ρ T 1 e 1 r 1 m 2 cos γ(t)·ρ T 1 e 1 r 1 m 3 m 4       =       −det(ρ 1 ρ T 2 ) sin γ(t)·ρ T 2 e 1 r 2 0 m 1 cos γ(t)·ρ T 2 e 1 r 2 m 2 m 3 cos γ(t)·ρ T 2 e 1 r 2 m 4       .
(4.21)

By the equality between the elements of the first row in the above expression one deduces that ρ T 1 e 2 and ρ T 2 e 2 must be parallel. This implies, in particular, that ρ 1 ρ T 2 = diag(m 1 , m 4 ) with m 1 , m 4 ∈ {±1}. It remains to prove that [γ] is a line segment parallel to ρ T 1 e 2 (and to ρ T 2 e 2 ). Observe that ρ 1 ρ T 2 = diag(m 1 , m 4 ) implies ρ 2 e 1 = m 1 ρ 1 e 1 , so that the equation (4.21) simplifies to 
     −m 1 sin γ(t)·ρ T 1 e 1 r 1 0 m 1 cos γ(t)·ρ T 1 e 1 r 1 0 0 m 4       =       −m 4 sin γ(t)·ρ T 1 e 1 r 2 0 m 1 cos γ(t)·ρ T 1 e 1 r 2 0 0 m 4       ,(4.22)
for every t ∈ [0, 1]. By differentiating the above equality restricted to the first elements of the first and second rows one gets
m 1 cos γ(t) · ρ T 1 e 1 r 1 γ(t) · ρ T 1 e 1 r 1 = m 4 cos γ(t) · ρ T 1 e 1 r 2 γ(t) · ρ T 1 e 1 r 2 sin γ(t) · ρ T 1 e 1 r 1 γ(t) · ρ T 1 e 1 r 1 = sin γ(t) · ρ T 1 e 1 r 2 γ(t) · ρ T 1 e 1 r 2
Clearly, (4.22) and the two above equalities holds true only ifγ(t) · ρ T 1 e 1 = 0 for every t ∈ [0, 1], implying thatγ ≡ e for some e ∈ R 2 parallel to ρ T 1 e 2 (and to ρ T 2 e 2 ). This concludes the proof of the necessary condition of the lemma in the case where γ(0) = (0, 0).

Considering now the case v := γ(0) − (0, 0) = 0, defineω := ω − v andŷ k := y k • τ v , k = 1, 2 (recall form Section 1.1 that τ v := · + v ∈ Trs(2)). By Remark 4.12, one can easily verify that
y k = T u k • R k •R θ k • C r k • ρ k ,(4.23)
where θ k := (w k · e 1 )/r k and u k := v k + R k • C r k (w k ), with w k := ρ k γ(0) − (0, 0) , for k = 1, 2.

Observe that the domainω is partitioned intoω 1 andω 2 by the subdivision curve [γ] − v which satisfies the condition γ(0) − v = (0, 0). It is now clear that y ∈ W 2,2 iso (ω) impliesŷ := y • τ v = y 1 χω 1 +ŷ 2 χω 2 ∈ W 2,2 iso (ω), which further implies that [γ] − v (and hence [γ]) is a line segment parallel to ρ T 1 e 2 and ρ T 2 e 2 , implying ρ 1 ρ T 2 = diag(σ 1 , σ 2 ), for some σ 1 , σ 2 ∈ {±1}, and that
v 1 + R 1 • C r 1 (w 1 ) = v 2 + R 2 • C r 2 (w 2 ) and R 1Rθ 1 T R 2Rθ 2 = diag σ 1 σ 2 , σ 1 , σ 2 ,
which are precisely conditions (i), (ii) and (iii).

(Sufficiency) Let y 1 , y 2 ∈ Cyl satisfy conditions (ii) and (iii). Let v := γ(0) − (0, 0) and let ρ ∈ SO(2) be a rotation which brings the line segment [γ] − v to the vertical position. Let y k := y k • τ v • ρ T . By denoting u := v 1 + R 1 • C r 1 (w 1 ) and R := R 1 •R θ 1 we have by (iii) that y :=ȳ 1 χ ω 1 +ȳ 2 χ ω 2 is of the form
y(x 1 , x 2 ) =      T u R r 1 cos(x 1 /r 1 ) − 1 , σ 1 1 r 1 sin(x 1 /r 1 ), σ 1 2 x 2 T , x 1 ≤ 0, T u R σ 1 σ 2 r 2 cos(x 1 /r 2 ) − 1 , σ 1 1 r 2 sin(x 1 /r 2 ), σ 1 2 x 2 T , x 1 > 0,(4.24)
where σ 1 k ∈ {±1} are such that ρ 1 ρ T = diag(σ 1 1 , σ 1 2 ) (which follows form the fact that ρ T 1 e 2 [γ]). By construction,ȳ ∈ C 1 (ω, R 3 ) withω = ρ(ω − v). Simple computations give ∂ 1ȳ , ∂ 2ȳ ∈ W 1,2 (ω, R 3 ), which implies thatȳ ∈ W 2,2 (ω, R 3 ). Note also that ∇ȳ(x ) T ∇ȳ(x ) = I 3 for a.e. x ∈ω. Thereforē y ∈ W 2,2 iso (ω), thus accordingly y :=ȳ • ρ • τ −v ∈ W 2,2 iso (ω).

Remark 4.12 (Properties of "roto-translations"). The following two properties, regarding the composition of cylinders, translations and rotations, can be easily proved.

(i) Fix R ∈ SO(3) and T w ∈ Trs(3). Then R • T w = T Rw • R.

(ii) Let τ v ∈ Trs(2) andR θ ∈ SO(3) be defined bŷ
R θ :=   cos θ − sin θ 0 sin θ cos θ 0 0 0 1   .
Then C r • τ v = T Cr(v) •R (v·e 1 )/r • C r , for every positive real number r.

In particular, property (ii) justifies the choice of the representation used for the elements in Cyl and it is useful for the proof of Lemma 4.8.


Applications to thin gel sheets

In this section, we apply the reduced model derived in Section 3 to the study of thin sheets of polymer gel. In the present context, a polymer gel is a network of cross-linked polymer chains swollen with a liquid solvent. Denote by v the volume per solvent molecule, by N the density of polymer chains in the reference volume and define R 3×3 1 := {F ∈ R 3×3 : detF ≥ 1}. The dimensionless free-energy density for isotropic polymer gels is of Flory-Rehner type (see [16]) and is given by the (isotropic) function W F R : R 3×3 1 → R defined as
W F R (F ) := vN 2 |F | 2 − 3 + W χ vol (detF ) + δ(detF − 1), for every F ∈ R 3×3 1 . (5.1)
Here χ ∈ (0, 1/2] and δ ≥ 0 are fixed dimensionless constants depending on the physical and chemical properties of the material and on environmental conditions, respectively. The function W χ vol : [1, +∞) → (−∞, 0] is of class C ∞ on (1, +∞) and continuous at 1. It satisfies
W χ vol (1) = 0, d dt W χ vol (t) < 0 for every t ∈ (1, +∞) and inf t∈[1,+∞) W χ vol (t) = χ − 1.
Let us now consider a heterogeneous thin gel sheet occupying the reference configuration Ω h (detailed analysis and results related to this model will be given in the forthcoming paper [4]). The heterogeneity arises from a z-dependent cross-linking density, which determines a variation in the density of polymer chains. More precisely, at a.e. point z ∈ Ω h we consider the variation of N given by 
N h (z) := N 1 + hg h z , z 3 h , for every h > 0, (5.2) where {g h } h≥0 ⊆ L ∞ (Ω) is such that g h → g 0 in L ∞ (Ω) as h → 0. Consequently, the corresponding (rescaled) family of free-energy densities {W h F R } h>0 consists of functions W h F R (x, F ) := v 2 N 1 + hg h (x) |F | 2 − 3 + W χ vol (detF ) + δ(detF − 1) − m h (x),(5.m h (x) := min F ∈R 3×3 v 2 N 1 + hg h (x) |F | 2 − 3 + W χ vol (detF ) + δ(detF − 1) ,
for a.e. x ∈ Ω and every h > 0. We also set, for every F ∈ R 3×3 1 , g 0 (·, t) dt = 0, in W −2,2 (ω), (5.6) with ∆ := ∂ 2 11 + ∂ 2 22 . Note that the condition (5.6) is equivalent to curl curlˆα /2 −α /2 b 0 α (·, t) dt I 2 = 0, in W −2,2 (ω α , Sym (2)).
W (F ) := W F R (F ) − m 0 , with m 0 := min R 3×3 W F R .(5.
Under this assumption, Theorem 3.3 can be applied to the family of functionals 
ˆα /2 −α /2 b 0 α (η , t) dt I 2 + η 3 Aỹ(η ) − b 0 α (η)I 2 dη, + ∞,
forỹ ∈ W 2,2 iso (ω α ), otherwise, with Q 2 given by (5.8) and (5.9) below. To discuss the relation between the "original" and αrescaled family of energy functionals, define the bijective map ψ : W 1,2 (Ω, R 3 ) → W 1,2 (Ω α , R 3 ) by ψ(y)(η) := y(η/α) for every η ∈ Ω α and every y ∈ W 1,2 (Ω, R 3 ). We also define W 2,2 α (ω) := y ∈ W 2,2 (ω, R 3 ) : |∂ 1 y| = |∂ 2 y| = α, ∂ 1 y · ∂ 2 y = 0 and note that ψ W 2,2 α (ω) = W 2,2 iso (ω α ). Given y ∈ W 2,2 α (ω) andỹ = ψ(y), one has that Aỹ(η ) = 1 α 4 A y η α , for a.e. η ∈ ω α .

By direct computations one can show that the quadratic form reads as Q α 3 (F ) = 2µ|F sym | 2 + λ tr 2 F, for every F ∈ R 3×3 , with µ and λ positive constants depending on physical parameters fixed at the beginning of this section. In turn, the quadratic form Q α 2 (G) := min
d∈R 3 Q α 3 Ĝ + d ⊗ f 3
for every G ∈ R 2×2 reads as Q α 2 (G) = 2µ |G sym | 2 + β tr 2 G , β := λ 2µ + λ .

(5.8)

Hence the corresponding α-rescaled quadratic form Q 3 is given by Given y ∈ W 1,2 Ω, R 3 andỹ = ψ(y) we have that
E h (y) =ˆΩ W h F R x, ∇ h y(x) dx = 1 α 3ˆΩ α W h F R η, ∇ hỹ (η) dη = 1 α 3 F h (ỹ).
It now clear that the sequence 1 h 2 E h Γ-converge to E 0 in W 1,2 (Ω, R 3 ), as h → 0, and the limiting functional E 0 is defined on W 1,2 (Ω, R 3 ) by
E 0 (y) :=      α 2 24ˆω Q α 2 1 α 3 A y (x ) − a 1 (x )I 2 dx +ˆω a 2 (x ) − a 3 (x ) dx , + ∞,
for y ∈ W 2,2 α (ω), otherwise, (5.10) where, setting b 0 := Θ g 0 , a 1 , a 2 , a 3 ∈ L ∞ (ω) are given by 
ˆ1 /2 −1 /2 b 0 (x , t) 2 dt − 6 ˆ1 /2 −1 /2 tb 0 (x , t) dt 2   Q α 2 (αI 2 )
a 3 (x ) := 1 2  with a 1 1 , a 2 1 non zero (an example of such g 0 is provided by Example 3.4). It is clear that the above g 0 satisfies (5.6), hence the 2D limiting model can be derived and is given by (5.10). Then, the target curvature tensor A(x ) equals a 1 (x )I 2 at each x ∈ ω, where a 1 (x ) = a 1 1 if x ∈ (−d, 0] × (0, ) and a 1 (x ) = a 2 1 if x ∈ (0, d) × (0, ). Finally, using the results of Lemma 4.8 and Lemma 4.11, we can determine the minimizers of the limiting energy E 0 . Note that we are in the case of Lipschitz 2-subdivision of ω into subdomains ω 1 := (−d, 0) × (0, ) and ω 2 := (0, d) × (0, ). Given that the subdivision curve is [γ 1 ] = ∂ω 1 ∩ ∂ω 2 = [0, ] (a line segment parallel to e 2 ) and A is of type (i) (see Lemma 4.1), a pointwise minimizer of E 0 exists and is any (up to rotations and translations in R 3 ) y := y 1 χ ω 1 + y 2 χ ω 2 ∈ W 2,2 α (ω), with y 1 , y 2 given by y 1 (x 1 , x 2 ) := α r 1 cos(x 1 /r 1 ) − 1 , σ 1 r 1 sin(x 1 /r 1 ), σ 2 x 2 T , for (x 1 , x 2 ) ∈ ω 1 , y 2 (x 1 , x 2 ) := α σ 0 r 2 cos(x 1 /r 2 ) − 1 , σ 1 r 2 sin(x 1 /r 2 ), σ 2 x 2 T , for (x 1 , x 2 ) ∈ ω 2 , with r k := 1/|r k |, r k = a k 1 (1 + 2β)/(1 + β) (see Lemma 4.1, (5.8) and (5.9)) for k = 1, 2, and appropriate choice (depending on the sign of r k , k = 1, 2) of σ i ∈ {−1, 1}, i = 0, 1, 2.

Definition 2. 1 (

Definition 4. 4 (
4Lipschitz n-subdivision). Fix n ∈ N, n ≥ 2. A family {ω k } n k=1 of open, bounded and connected subsets of R 2 is said to be a Lipschitz n-subdivision of ω provided it can be obtained via the following procedure:• Call ω 1 := ω.• Suppose that for every k = 1, . . . , n − 1 there exists a continuous injective curve γ k : [0, 1] → cl(ω k ) such that ∂ω k ∩ [γ k ] = γ k (0), γ k (1) (note that γ k (0) = γ k (1)) and the two connected components of ω k \ [γ k ] are Lipschitz. Then call ω k+1 one of such connected components. • Once the domains ω 1 , . . . , ω n are defined, let ω k := ω k \ cl(ω k+1 ) for every k = 1, . . . , n − 1 and let ω n := ω n .In particular, the subdomains ω 1 , . . . , ω n of ω are Lipschitz domains such that


{0, ±r k } are the eigenvalues (principal curvatures) of the (constant) curvature tensors ranging in N k .

Consider a thin film made of polymeric gel occupying the domain Ω h where ω = (−d, d) × (0, ) and with associated family of energy densities {W h F R } given by (5.3). Suppose that the variation of the number of polymeric chains N h given by (5.2) is such that the associated limiting function g 0 is of the formg 0 (x , x 3 ) := g 1 (x 3 ), if x ∈ (−d, 0] × (0, ) g 2 (x 3 ), if x ∈ (0, d) × (0, ),with g 1 , g 2 ∈ L ∞ ((x , t) dt = 0 for all x ∈ ω,


clear that there exists two different (up to rotations and translation in R 3 ) minimizing surfaces y(ω). The choice of σ 1 ∈ {−1, 1} determines one of the two possible options for y 1 , represented by a dashed or a full black line in Figure 4 below. For any chosen value of σ 1 , the values of σ 2 and σ 0 are immediately determined by the sign of r 1 and r 2 , respectively.

One corresponds to a full line (by choosing σ 1 = −1) and the other one to a dashed line (by choosing σ 1 = 1). For both choices of σ 1 , the value of the target curvature r 2 uniquely determines the value of σ 0 and thus "decides" whether (both) intersections are black-red (if σ 0 = 1) or black-green (if σ 0 = −1) lines.

Remark 5.1. We remark that the (rescaled) energy densities W h F R (x, ·) defined by (5.3) are minimized on α 1 + hΘg h (x) SO(3), for every h > 0 and a.e. x ∈ Ω, for some α > 1 and Θ ∈ R \ {0}. Moreover, they uniformly converge to W given by (5.4), which is minimized at α SO(3). However, by directly confronting formulas (5.4) and (5.3), one can check that the densities W h F R cannot be rewritten in the "prestretch" form
