The purpose of this study was to describe the implementation of song in teaching speaking competency as well as problems encountered by teachers during the implementation at SD N 2 Tembok, Buleleng Regency. Researchers collected data in a qualitative way, through interviews and observation. Then, the data were analyzed through 3 processes proposed byDull & Reinhardt (2014). The purpose of implementing song in all stages in learning is to make students adapted with the English vocabulary and pronunciation by using fun method which is via song which is familiar for the students. Based on the result of this study, it can be concluded that the teacher basically implemented the song to the learning in three activities such as opening activity, whilst activity and closing activity by giving the link of youtube video to the students as well as helping them in translation to encourage the students to learning to speak English by using song. The problem that mostly occurred in the class to teach song for speaking English was internet connection due to online class caused of covid-19 pandemic. Because of that, doing voice recording is needed for the students to check their grammar as well as their pronunciation.

INTRODUCTION

English is considered a foreign language that is difficult to teach in Indonesia. According to Derakhshan and Shirmohammadli, (2015), learning English as a foreign or second language in Indonesia is difficult because learners cannot use English in everyday life situations and they learn sentences based on textbooks, not in a real environment. Therefore, the problem is how teachers can manage the teaching and learning process while facing this phenomenon Rokhayani, (2014) explained that the teacher is the main key in the classroom during the teaching and learning process. This means that teachers must be able to deliver material effectively to overcome student difficulties in learning English. One of them is by communicating a lot with students.

English has been taught in Indonesia since elementary school, but teachers still face several obstacles in delivering material to students. One way is that communication between teachers and students through the communication of ideas, thoughts, or information will be conveyed well (Lems, 2018). This is in line with Tobergte and Curtis, (2013), explained speaking activities can be successful if the first students talk a lot. All activities are allocated and focused on students so that activities will be spent with talks. Second participation is evenly distributed all students get the opportunity to speak. Third, high motivation students are more enthusiastic to speak because they have something new to say. And finally, the language is at an acceptable level. This means that students express themselves in words that are easy to understand.

In other to overcome these problems the teacher can implement songs as a media of learning that is currently available. According to Johann, (2017), a good classroom atmosphere will help teachers deliver material to students, make students more active, make the learning process more enjoyable, and motivate students. This means that the song in the learning process can be used as a component to achieve learning objectives. So the teacher must develop the methods and the media that will be used for the teaching and learning process (Abdul, 2012).

One of the teacher's roles is to have an effective media for teaching English as a foreign language in Indonesia. According to Aderson, (2020), that teachers must have learning media so that students are more interested in learning English. According to Roslim, (2011), there are several aspects that affect success in learning, namely teaching materials and learning media. In teaching materials, it depends on the syllabus according to each school. After that the learning media in the teaching and learning process are very dependent on the knowledge and creativity of the teacher in carrying it out. So, this aspect greatly affects student achievement during the learning process. Especially in teaching young learners, they need creativity and media to create a better atmosphere for the teaching and learning process.

In teaching for young learners, teachers are required to be able to use good media in the learning process in the classroom. A pleasant situation will make it easier for teachers and students to interact (Millington, 2011). According to Sepik (2012) ,the media that needs to be used when teaching young learners' is the teacher pronounces a word and the students will listen and then follow this is usually called the listen and repeat. Therefore, students will be involved in fun activities that have been designed especially for young learners, such as singing, storytelling, etc. The use of songs in the learning process is very important. According to Octaberlina, (2020), that using songs in the learning process produces positive things. Like the text in a song accompanied by music, which makes the listener happy and excited, as well as a song can be a speech tool that will indirectly be remembered in the brain's memory (Garvich, 2016). According to , Liva, (2014), the selection criteria are based on the concept that songs are part of the whole learning system. Then some of the criteria that need to be considered in selecting a good song are in accordance with the learning objectives, practical, flexible, and durable, the teacher is able and skilled in using songs, grouping student goals, and technical quality which means songs can make the classroom atmosphere better. With that also the song is one of the media that will be more interesting and easier to understand. And also, can be used to support and assist teachers in dealing with problems in delivering material to students.

The Art of Teaching English as a Foreign Language However, there were some obstacles faced by teachers in the teaching and learning process. Based on a survey conducted by Anggarini, (2020), it was found that the standard score (KKM) for English was 75, while the learning achievement value for subjects was 68.27. On the other hand, Liva, (2014), also shows that teachers have difficulty guiding and handling student activities because they are less interested in subjects. In addition, according to other research conducted by Ratminingsih and Mahayanti, (2015), it shows that teachers use more textbooks that are oriented towards teaching English accompanied by drill and repetition techniques. The results of the questionnaire showed that 61% of the 180 teachers stated difficulties in making their own material and 54% stated difficulties in using innovative media for learning.

In relation to the problems faced by the teacher, learning media such as songs are needed to create an effective teaching and learning process. According to Hui and Lin (2020), the use of songs in learning English will help students more easily connect concepts to the context. In addition, students will indirectly improve their speaking competence, and the students will find it easier to talk to their teachers or friends. There are problems in using songs in the teaching and learning process. According to SarÄ±coban and Metin (2000), the selection of songs must be paid close attention to as well as songs that will be given according to age, the language used in the song. In addition, the problem that often occurs using songs in the teaching and learning process is that students do not understand the lyrics contained in the song.

After that, the use of songs in the teaching and learning process is very important. According to Permana (2020), by using songs the material will be more interesting and easier to understand. In addition, it can be used to support and assist teachers in dealing with problems in delivering material to students. According to Dincel, (2017), teaching English using songs has many things that can increase students' interest in learning English. Learning English using songs has a very positive impact on students when learning English. Some things learned in learning English use songs and improve students' memory in saying words or memorizing the lyrics they sing. In addition to being able to increase their own enthusiasm through songs, students can also form groups to increase interest in learning.

Songs can also improve students' mood in learning English and can motivate students to learn. In addition, the use of songs can also increase vocabulary and can practice student pronunciation through song lyrics (Garvich, 2016). Besides get vocabulary and practicing pronunciation, students can also find out some of the grammar contained in the song lyrics (Roslim, 2011). Thus, the song greatly affects the psychology of students because the song can reduce the stress experienced by many students. Songs can also reduce student boredom in learning and make it easier for students to find songs. Therefore, songs are one of the best ways to use them in learning.

So based on the preliminary observations, it was found that one English teacher at SD N 2 Tembok applied song as a learning media to teach speaking English. During a pandemic situation, teachers use songs as a media of learning because it makes it easier for teachers to teach through online media because it teaches young learners to practice speaking English. Students are given a song in the form of a video via YouTube and sent to the WhatsApp group of 6 th grade. The researcher did five times to observations, the first observation to ask permission and four times observed online class learning through WhatsApp groups and virtual meetings. The songs are given according to the level of students and in each meeting using a different song. The students will get new vocabulary and students can add the vocabulary in the song or sing the song, so that they can practice students' speaking competence. Therefore, the researcher conducted this research using qualitative descriptive to describe the implementation of songs as a media of learning in teaching speaking competency at SD N 2 Tembok.


METHOD

This study was descriptive qualitative research. According to Nassaji, (2015), a qualitative study is a methodology in which the data describe descriptively, which focuses on the understanding, perspective, and attitude of the guardian towards collecting data taken from various sources. It focused on making descriptions systematically and accurately based on facts about certain objects observed. Data in this study needed to answer the research questions. This study focused on observing the implementation of song for teaching English at SD N 2 Tembok. The data were taken from the observation and interview with the teachers. In this research after the researcher get data, the researcher analyzed data through 3 processes proposed by Dull & Reinhardt, (2014).

The researcher using purposive sampling technique as sample because it can provide maximum detail data. Therefore, this study describes the implementation of songs in teaching English. Purposive sampling is a technique that does not require theory, this technique is called judgment sampling (Tongco, 2007). The purposive sampling technique usually uses informant techniques or what is commonly referred to as someone who is able to provide information based on experience and knowledge (Etikan, 2016). Usually, informants share information related to what we will need. In this case, the criteria of the sample were basically the one who can provide the information relevant to this study based on the recommendation and situation on the research site. So, the researcher get data from one English teacher to teaching English using song in sixth-grade because he is able to provide detailed data and he is the only one who implements the song as media to teaching English for young learner at SD N 2 Tembok.

The Art of Teaching English as a Foreign Language It can be seen that the implementation of song in teaching speaking can be seen in pre-activity when the teacher related the learning theme to the songs (apperception activity) as well in introducing the material by using song by giving the link for the song. The teacher used everyday life song that students are used to listening in which in teaching greeting, the teacher used song from YouTube.


Figure 2. Main Activities

Figure 3. Closing Activities


Figure 4.3 Post Activity

The teacher ends the class by singing together with the students to maintain the atmosphere of the class which is already adapted with the activity with song and to make a good last impression for the student so students are motivated to learn again.

This study aimed to identify the implementation using songs as media in teaching English in SD N 2 Tembok as well as the problems using songs as media in teaching English in SD N 2 Tembok. Using observation sheet and interview guide. Each of the data from those instruments showed similarity. It can be seen from the result of observation in which the implementation of song in teaching English can be seen in pre-activity when the teacher related the learning theme to the songs (apperception activity) as well in introducing the material by using song by giving the link for the song. The teacher used everyday life song that students are used to listening to such as How are you I'm fine, Months of the years, Head Shoulders, and Ethan music. The teacher also tries to encourage the students to speak English by using song based on their daily life. The purpose of implementing the song in pre-activity is for making student ready to learn or it can be said as brainstorming the students which means the students need to observe the song and see the lyric of the song. This is good for their mental readiness to learn English. This is in line to Mokhtar, (2017), and Sari, Asahra, (2019), who stated the appropriate song drives to the learning climate that is expected by the teacher to happen in the classroom. Besides, Keray Dincel, (2017), explained that using songs in class improves student memory and student enthusiasm in learning English as well as improve students' mood in learning English either through lyrics or words that have been obtained through songs that have been heard by students.

In main activity, the teacher implements the song by asking the students to make a singing video based on the song that has been sent to WhatsApp group. The purpose of doing this activity is to make a record for students in order to make teacher feels easy to detect some mispronunciation occurred by the students. This activity was also good to practice their spoken grammar in which the teacher can replay or pause some part of the song to correct the students. The teacher continued to implement the song to continue the mental readiness which was already built-in pre-activity because the teacher did want the students to lose

The Art of Teaching English as a Foreign Language interest or lose their motivation to learn if the song did not continue in the main activity. This is in line with Ghanbari and Hashemian (2014), who stated that the impact of student learning abilities and student skills when carrying out activities during learning indirectly helps motivate students to be remembered by students.

Using video was studied to be able to improve students listening and speaking skills (Kristiani & Pradnyadewi, 2021). This was also supported by a study conducted by Sanjaya et al., (2022) who found that visual media such as video was able to encourage and motivate students to learn new vocabulary.

In the post-activity, the teacher ends the class by singing together with the students to maintain the atmosphere of the class which is already adapted with the activity with song and to make a good last impression for the student so students are motivated to learn again even though the teacher did not sing a song for a long time in the post activity due to the location in the countryside, which makes it difficult for teachers to even rarely use the Google meet application, or zoom due to signal limitations, and students' cellphones. Besides, some of the student's lack of response makes the teacher a little bit difficult to invite students to close the lesson by singing together before the class ends. Based on this explanation, it can be seen that the teacher wanted to create an interesting closing as stated by Mokhtar , (2017), and Sari, Asahra, (2019), in which as the song is used to make a comfort and fun learning climate, the ending of implementing song must be memorable by inviting students to sing the song together so that they feel that the learning activity is meaningful.

Based on 4 times observation, the teacher taught speaking by using different song in different days. The reason was to make it in line with the lesson and to make students feel happy and not bored because of same song. In teaching, the teacher used song from YouTube link. The teacher used song in introducing topic in pre-activity. Next, the teacher used song in the main activity to train student's pronunciation by asking students to sing a song. The teacher also used song to teach students about new vocabulary, especially the vocabulary related to the current topic. In the end, the teacher sang a song together with the students. This is in line with the previous research as stated by Mokhtar , (2017), and Sari, Asahra, (2019), in which as the song is used to make a comfort and fun learning climate, the ending of implementing song must be memorable by inviting students to sing the song together so that they feel that the learning activity is meaningful.


CONCLUSIONS

Overall, the teacher wanted to apply the song for all stages in learning English speaking starts from pre-activity until post-activity. The purpose of implementing sing in all stages in learning is to make students adapted with the English vocabulary and pronunciation by using fun method which is via song which is familiar for the students. The teacher believes by hearing a real song from native speaker, the students can imitate the style and able to pronounce the English word well. Based on the result from observation sheet, the problems of teaching English by using song can be seen from the teachers' problem in which due to internet connection and the students respond. Next, the problem occurred by the students was the students' understanding of the song in which there are some words in the song that students do not really understand the meaning of the words contained in the song.

In terms of teacher's problem, the teacher cannot continue to sing a song for a long time together in the end of the lesson due to the location in the countryside, which makes it difficult for teachers to even rarely use the Google meet application, or zoom due to signal limitations, and students' cellphones. Besides, some of the student's lack of response makes the teacher a little bit difficult to invite students to close the lesson by singing together before the class ends. This is in line with the result from interview guide in which the teacher tried to match the current condition of the students to the song for the learning in order to make them felt comfortable to the song and also enjoyed the lesson because somehow the students were difficult to open the link which made them demotivated to learn. The teacher did motivation in online meeting and ask the students to discuss their problem so the students keep focusing on their learning. The teacher also keeps sending the YouTube link of the song to keep them to learn.

The vocabularies were varied based on the variation of the song in which the student learned more vocabularies if the students watched and understand more songs which meant teacher needed to consider the choice of the material in which it must keep updated because relying on the same recording or song would not be enough. By keep updating the song, the fun learning can be maintained. Besides, the teacher also needed to control and measured the students speed speech by using simple English translation which was less than 3 syllables. If the translation was more than 3 syllables, the teacher interpreted the sing slowly to make students easy to understand. This is in line with Lems, (2018), explained that songs can stimulate the brain using magneto encephalographic imaging to see how students respond after listening to music and several types of music genres make it easier for students to understand and practice speaking fluently, especially in learning English. As a result, music with the right genre and tempo can make students more interested and more relaxed in participating in learning, indirectly students will sing along and practice speaking in saying a word or sentence in English which makes students more active and confident in learning English as well as improve their competence in speaking, pronouncing words and phrases.
