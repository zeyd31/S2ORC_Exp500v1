Bonesini
LaBr 3 :Ce crystals, with photomultiplier or single SiPM readout (up to 3x3 mm 2 ) have been introduced for radiation imaging in medical physics. An R&D was pursued with 1/2" and 1" LaBr3:Ce crystals, from different producers, to realize compact large area detectors (up to some cm 2 area) with SiPM array readout, aiming at high light yields, good energy resolution, good detector linearity and fast time response for low-energy X-rays. The study was triggered by the FAMU experiment at the RIKEN-RAL muon facility, aiming at a precise measurement of the proton Zemach radius to solve the so-called "proton radius puzzle". The goal is the detection of characteristic X-rays around 130 KeV. Other applications may be foreseen for homeland security and -ray astronomy. Results were obtained with a direct readout based on a CAEN V1730 FADC, with no need for an amplification stage. At the Cs 137 peak, energy resolutions up to ∼ 3% were obtained, using a readout with Hamamatsu SiPM arrays. These results compare well with best available results obtained with a PMT readout.

Introduction

The need of large area, compact crystal detectors, with good linearity and energy resolution, read by SiPM is arising in many fields from fundamental physics experiments, such as FAMU [1,2], to PET [3], homeland security and − ray astronomy. Even if they are hygroscopic, the good light yeld (75000 /MeV) and short decay time (∼ 30 ns) of LaBr 3 :Ce crystals makes them the best choice, as respect to other crystals as PrLuAg or Ce:GAGG [4]. Our & is based on LaBr 3 :Ce crystals of increasing size (1/2 inches to 1 inches) read by SiPM arrays, whose gain drift with temperature is corrected online by a custom NIM module. The signals from the different cells of the readout array (4 for SENSL arrays, 16 for the other arrays) are summed up and read in parallel, to be later digitized by a fast CAEN V1730 FADC. As the signal is sizeable: ∼ 100 mV at the Cs 137 peak, there is no need for an amplification stage. The crystal and the SiPM array are housed in a 3D ABS printed holder, as shown in the right panel of figure 1. The optical contact between the crystal and the SiPM array is realized through Bicron BC631 silicone optical grease. To correct for the gain drift of SiPM with temperature, an Analog Devices TMP37 sensor is mounted on the back of each SiPM array. The temperature information is then used by a custom made module, based on CAEN A7585D units, to make an online correction (see reference [1,6] for more details). The effect on the detector response (P.H. in a.u.) between 10 • C and 40 • C is reduced from 60 (40) % to less than 6 (10) % for 1/2" (1") detectors (see figure 2 for an example). While 1/2" crystals are cubic in shape: 14 × 14 × 14 mm 3 , 1" crystals are round and 0.5" thick The used SiPM arrays are shown, with their main characteristics, in table 1. Operating voltages are set to + overvoltage, where the overvoltage is chosen according to manufacturer's specifications.

we estimated a 88 % efficiency for 100 (200) keV X-rays with a 0.33 (1.54) cm thickness crystal, from tabulated X-ray mass attenuation coefficients [7]. This estimation has been confirmed by a refined MonteCarlo simulation based on the MNCP code [8]. Thus for detection of signal X-rays with energy ∼ 130 keV in FAMU, a 0.5 inch thickness is adequate. 


Results from laboratory tests

Laboratory tests were done putting the detectors under test inside a Memmert IPV-30 climatic chamber, where the temperature could be stabilized with a precision of ∼ 0.1 • C. Tests were done mainly at 25 • C in the following. Detectors were powered at their nominal operating voltage , as reported in table 1. Different exempt X-rays sources (Cd 109 , Co 57 , Ba 133 , Na 22 , Cs 137 , Mn 54 ) were used. The summed analogue signal from the cells of a SiPM array is directly fed into a CAEN V1730 fast digitizer (500 MHz bandwidth, 14 bit resolution) and is acquired by a custom developed DAQ system [9]. Produced n-tuples are analyzed by the ROOT package [10]. Figure 2 reports linearity and FWHM energy resolution for readout made with different SiPM arrays of the same LaBr 3 :Ce crystal. Resolutions up to 3% at the Cs 137 peak are obtained with Hamamatsu or Sensl arrays. They compare well with what obtained with the best PMT readout. Detectors with SiPM array readout have typically longer risetimes (∼ 20 ns for 20-80 % risetime) as compared to ones with fast PMT readout. To reduce this problem, due to the used parallel ganging of SiPM cells, an hybrid ganging solution is under study. Figure 3 shows the results obtained with a sample of LaBr 3 :Ce 1/2" crystals read by Hamamatsu S13161-3050 arrays. Figure 4 reports instead linearity and FWHM energy the FAMU experiment (∼ 130 keV) resolution up to ∼ 7% are obtained. This compares well, with what obtained with a conventional PMT readout, as shown in reference [11].


Performances in beam

In December 2018, eight 1/2" detectors were used for the FAMU data taking, where the RIKEN-RAL pulsed muon beam impinged on a target filled with a 2 + 2 (0.3%) mixture at 7 or 11 bar pressure at 80 • K. After background subtraction (in red), signals corresponding to the Oxygen or / lines at ∼ 130 and 160 keV are clearly visible (in green) in the delayed spectra, reported in figure 5 [12]. The use of two crowns of LaBr 3 :Ce crystals read by SiPM arrays is foreseen for the final FAMU data taking in 2022-2023, in addition to one equipped with conventional PMTs.

Conclusions

Good performances and FWHM energy resolution up to 3% have been obtained for both 1/2" and 1" LaBr 3 :Ce crystals read by SiPM arrays. The gain drift with temperature was corrected online by a custom developed NIM module, based on CAEN A7585D units.
