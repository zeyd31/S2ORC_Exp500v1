. Absorption spectra of OTN-PSt NPs (5 mg/mL in water) with different ratio of styrene and acrylic acid monomers. The absorption peak of 1050-1150 nm is majorly luminescent IR-1061, while the absorption of 750-800 nm is derived from IR-1061 interacted with water. Adding acrylicacid monomer increased the loading of emissive IR-1061 to OTN-PSt NPs; however, IR-1061 seemed to interact strongly with water when the NPs were prepared in the solvent containing 5% DMSO. 


Analysis of quantum yield of the OTN-PSt-PEG NP

The fluorescence quantum yield of OTN-PSt-PEG NPs in water was analyzed according to the previous publication(*1) using the OTN-NIR fluorescence IR-26 dye as the reference (quantum yield = 0.5%). For reference calibration, IR-26 dye was diluted by 1,2-dichloroethane (DCE; refractive index: 1.44) to prepare five samples with their absorbance value at 980 nm of ~0.14, ~0.12, ~0.10, ~0.08, and ~0.06. Then, the fluorescence emission was collected in the 1000-1500 nm region under an extinction wavelength of 980 nm. The similar operation were also performed for OTN-PSt-PEG NPs in water (refractive index: 1.33). All of the emission profiles of samples were integrated into the 1000-1500 nm region, and the integrated photoluminescence was plotted against the absorbance intensity (980 nm) to obtain a linear function. Finally, the fluorescence quantum yield was calculated based on the equation as follows:

The data was fitted into a linear function with a slope of 141.14, giving a measured quantum yield of 0.65%.
