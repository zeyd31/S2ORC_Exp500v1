Perf o rmance in cognitive tests can be influenced by age and education level.In developing countries, formal education is limited for most people.Application of the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) test, in its original version could have an adverse effect on the evaluation of low educated and elderly individuals.O b j e c t i v e: To assess the cognitive perf o rmance of low and middle educated old people in a modified version of the adapted to portuguese language MMSE.M e t h o d: A study was carr i e d out enrolling 253 individuals, aged 60 to 90 years included in different schooling levels.Four educational g roups were studied: illiterate;1-4 schooling years; 5-8 schooling years and over 8 schooling years.Besides, the sample was also studied according to six classes: 60-65, 66-70, 71-75, 76-80, 81-85 and 86-90 years.The modified version (mo-MMSE) included modifications in copy and calculation items from the adapted MMSE (ad-MMSE) to Portuguese language.The maximum possible score was the same in the two versions: total, 30; copy, 1 and calculation, 5. Results: mo-MMSE scores were significantly higher than ad-MMSE for every age classes.A negative correlation was observed between age and scores in individuals of 1-4 and in individuals over eight schooling years, both in ad-MMSE and mo-MMSE.However, there was not a significant c o rrelation between age and scores in illiterate group and in individuals of 5-8 schooling years.C o n c l u s i o n: The modification of copy and calculation items of ad-MMSE, are responsible by the best perf o rmance in mo-MMSE.Cultural background could have influenced this result.Individuals with more than eight years of formal instruction are protected against a reduction of their capacity to solve cognitive tests.However, low instructed individuals have not this capacity and so they present signals of intellectual aging before they become elderly people.

Influência da idade e escolaridade sobre a perf o rmance da versão modificada do Mini-Exame do Estado Mental: estudo no nordeste do Brasil RESUMO -A realização de testes cognitivos pode ser influenciada por fatores como idade e educação.Nos países em desenvolvimento, a educação formal está limitada para a maioria da população.A aplicação do teste Mini-Exame do Estado Mental (MEEM), na sua versão original, pode ter efeito adverso em pessoas com baixo nível de educação e idosos.Objetivo: Avaliar a performance cognitiva da população de baixo e médio nível de educação e idosa em uma versão modificada do MEEM adaptado para língua portuguesa.M é t o d o: Foram estudados 253 indivíduos idosos com idades entre 60 e 90 anos incluídos em diferentes níveis de escolaridade.O estudo foi constituído por quatro grupos de escolaridade: analfabeto; 1-4 anos; 5-8 anos e mais de 8 anos.A amostra também foi estudada de acordo com seis classes: 60-65, 66-70, 71-75, 76-80, 81-85 e 86-90 anos.A versão modificada (MEEM-mo) incluiu modificações nos itens de cópia e cálculo da versão adaptada (MEEM-ad) para a língua portuguesa.O escore máximo foi o mesmo para ambas as versões: total, 30; cópia, 1 e cálculo, 5. Resultados: O escore do MEEM-mo foi mais significativo do que o do MEEM-ad para cada classe de idade.Uma correlação negativa foi observada entre a idade e o escore em indivíduos de 1-4 anos e em indivíduos com mais de oito anos de escolaridade, ambas no MEEM-ad e MEEM-mo.Não existia correlação significante entre idade e escore no grupo de analfabetos e nos indivíduos de 5-8 anos de escolaridade.C o n c l u s ã o: As modificações realizadas nos itens cópia e cálculo do MEEM-ad são responsáveis pela melhor perf o rmance encontrada no MEEM-mo.Os fatore s culturais podem ter influenciado este resultado.Indivíduos com mais de oito anos de instrução formal são protegidos contra uma redução de suas capacidades para solucionar testes cognitivos.Entretanto, indivíduos com baixo nível de instrução não têm esta capacidade e, dessa forma, apresentam sinais de envelhecimento antes de se tornarem pessoas idosas.Detailed assessment of cognitive function is essential for accurate diagnosis and management in general neurological practice.This re q u i res a high degree of training by a neurologist or a psychologist, besides to be time-consuming 1 .Among the cognitive tests there is the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) proposed to diff e rentiate patients with non-specified organic brain syndro m e and depression from normal individuals, being useful both in quantitatively estimating the severity of cognitive impairment and in documenting serially cognitive changes 2 .Assessing MMSE in re s e a rc h p rotocols is particularly important to establish the incidence or prevalence of cognitive impairm e n t and to examine correlates of mental status 3 .


PALAVRAS-CHAVE

The fact that in underdeveloped and developing countries a high formal education is not supplied for large population groups could bring negative consequences for cognitive abilities of many people.

A reduced perf o rmance has been observed particularly in tests evaluating cognition of elderly a n d low educated individuals 4 , 5 .Besides, cultural backg round can influence perf o rmance in tests such as MMSE because some particular items in this test could re p resent diff e rent meanings for different c u l t u re s 6 , 7 .According to Fratiglioni et al. 8 , the perf o rmance on the MMSE is variable among countries.This might be due to different educational levels of the population, or to different curricula s t ru c t u resof the same schooling level in diff e re n t countries.Thus, "norms" or "adjustment techniques" derived from one country cannot be consid e red universally applicable.In order to pre v e n t the possibility of education to mask the perf o rmance in this test and, as a consequence, to re p resent a potential risk factor for cognitive assessment, it is opportune to reassess the validity of the MMSE whenever it is going to be used in a new population.Although adaptation of MMSE to Brazilian cultural context has been made by Bert o l u c c i et al. 4 this did not solve specific problems found in the execution of the test in regions as Brazil N o rtheast.Such is the use of noums for evaluation of immediate memory, which have not the same meaning in diff e rent regions of Brazil (e.g the w o rd s t a p e t e and c a n e c a). Items measuring recall of thre e w o rds, pentagon copy, and orientation in time seem to be most sensitive to both normal aging and dementing illnesses 9 .Yet It is well known that for low instructed individuals is not easy to solve calculation problems.Considering these aspects it is important to minimize false positive results in testing low educated people living in those cultural contexts.In the present study, MMSE 4 c o p y and calculation items were changed according to the cultural background of Brazil Northeast, in order to investigate the issue.


METHOD

A randomized cross-sectional study using both a modified and the adapted to Portuguese language M M S E v e r s i o n 4 ( t h e reafter called re s p e c t i v e l y, mo-MMSE and ad-MMSE) enrolling 253 individuals (187 women and 66 men), aged between 60 and 90 years (69,4 ± 6,8 years), with low and middle formal instruction, re s i d e n t s in Olinda city, Pernambuco, Brazil, was perf o rmed.Individuals belonged to low and middle socio-economic classes of the county.Previously to the application of the test people were inquired about their normal daily routine.Individuals able to conduct theirselves as well as to recognize primary and secondary colors, time in a clock, cash money, and to use a tin opener, were admitted to the study.A clinical interview was made in ord e r to investigate neurological and psychiatric diseases.People with low visual or auditory acuity, motor or rh e u m atic disturbance, chronic alcoholism, cardiovascular disease, recent head trauma (last 12 months) or not motivated, were excluded.During interview all individuals revealed interest to participate in the study.

According to the schooling level, four groups were constituted as follows: group illiterate (n=28) -individuals without any formal schooling instruction; group 1-4 degree (n=119) -individuals with 1 to 4 years of formal instruction; group 5-8 degree (n=85) -individuals with 5 to 8 years of formal instruction; and group over 8 degree (n=21) -individuals with 8 or more years of f o rmal instruction.Besides, the sample was studied a c c o rding to six age classes re g a rdless on score schooling levels: 60-65, 66-70, 71-75, 76-80, 81-85 and 86-90 years.

Both tests were applied to individuals in their homes.The determination of scores in ad-MMSE and mo-MMSE was made as indicated in Brito-Marques and Cabral-Fil h o 1 0 .For the diff e rent schooling levels a corre l a t i o n between the achieved score and age was determ i n e d .


RESULTS

As we can see (Table 1) the scores in mo-MMSE w e re higher than in ad-MMSE for every age class.Differences between means ranged from 1.59 to 3.57 points (p<0.001, for all comparisons).

Considering the whole sample a positive high c o rrelation (r = 0.878, p<0.001) between score s achieved in mo-MMSE and ad-MMSE (Figure ), was observed.

In Table 2, as we can verify, there was not a significant relationship between age and scores in illiterate and in 5 to 8 years schooling groups, not only in ad-MMSE but in mo-MMSE as well.Howev e r, a negative correlation exists (Table 2) between age and scores for the individuals of 1-4 (r=-0.298,p<0.01 and r=-0.212,p<0.05), for ad-MMSE and mo-MMSE, respectively) and over 8 years of schooling both in ad-MMSE (r=-0.473,p=0.030) and in mo-MMSE (r=-0.469,p=0.032).


DISCUSSION

From the best perf o rmance observed in all age classes of the modified MMSE version when comp a red to the adapted MMSE 4 we can conclude that the introduced copy and calculation item changes, facilitated the solution of the tasks.Since this imp rovement was observed in every age class, it is likely that the best mo-MMSE copy and calculation item achievement to be associated with basic knowledge of culture features in which that people have lived for a long time 1 0 .In Brazil Nort h e a s t some of these features, such as recognizing a triangle, is easier than recognizing a pentagon.In fact, triangle is a geometric figure simpler than pentagon; moreover in their daily activity, people routinely deal with triangle shapes (popular musical instruments, objects for playing), but not with pentagon shapes 2 .The recognition might be even m o re difficult when the overlapping drawing of  the figures in the test is re q u i red.So cultural backg round acquired out of the school can impro v e the capacity of individuals to solve the pro b l e m , because a familiar figure is included in mo-MMSE but not in ad-MMSE.These findings indicate that informal knowledge about geometric shapes is an importa ntway to face the test challenge.In a similar way, calculation of serial 25-1 instead serial 100-7 could be easier for individuals in Brazil Northeast because in their daily life activities, numerical simple tasks are intensive and much more frequent than the complexes ones.It is well known that cultural opportunities play a role in cognitive p e rf o rmance in adult and old individuals 1 1 .As showed by Li et al. 1 2 , the solution of calculation pro blems can suffer influence of schooling, socio-economic status and cultural background.By studying illiterate individuals Tsolaki et al. 1 3 m o d i f i e d the serial task 100-7 in MMSE 2 test to serial week days obtaining better results than in the original task.Further, since anxiety is a basic factor in test situations, the presentation of a simple pro b l e m to individuals with a low intellectual basis could elicit less anxiety than the presentation of a more complex task, so facilitating the problem solution, as demonstrated by Brucki 14 .

In this study, the lack of a relationship between age and score in two schooling levels lower than eight years and, on the other hand, a decreasing s c o re with the age increasing for individuals over eight schooling years (negative correlation), are n o t e w o rt h y.First of all, this fact could indicate that, the formal learning in some schooling classes in Brazil Northeast is failing at preparing individuals to manage geometrical and arithmetical problems even of low complexity.We would also suppose that people included in that schooling g roups have forgotten most of the cognitive information acquired during their childhood, because their daily usual activities do not encompass intellectual tasks at the same intensity as those of the highest schooling individuals.In addition the highest correlation found in the group over eight years education level suggests that people with the highest instruction are protected against a re d u c t i o n of its capacity to solve cognitive problems.By the other hand, it should be considered the possibility that other factors besides formal instruction are involved in the resolution of that kind of pro blems, as showed by Carraher et al. 1 5 .These authors showed that strategies to solve aritmetical and geometric problems differ between people with and people without formal instruction.In the inf o rmal condition the use of computational and drawing rules derives from their daily occupations and working tasks.Regarding this point we can t h e re f o resuggest that illiterate or low instru c t e d individuals, when evaluated through cognitive t e s t s based on a more sofisticated matematical language, could display signs of aging even before they become elderly people.However, individuals of i n f o rmal conditions, although unable to solve mathematical questions through classical algorithms, can solve the same problems by using the knowledge got from the training in their regular profissional activities 15 .

In this study the large diff e rences of schooling g roup sizes could influence the statistical results as a confounding factor so limiting the data interpretation.The significant correlation between age and s c o re for 1-4 schooling years group (119 individuals) but no correlation for the illiterate one (28 individuals) could be due to the well known sample g reat size effect which facilitate to obtain statistical significance in this type of association test 1 6 , 1 7 .So, this result should be taken cautiousy.However, the correlation magnitude in the over eight years g roup being almost two times that in the 1-4 years schooling group indicate also that higher form a l education has a substantial participation in improvement of the cognitive perf o rmance.

The inadequate basic instruction supplied by the school can re p resent a serious public health and social problem (which will not deal with here , but requires a special attention of public authorities in the country).On the other hand, since the s c o res of the two test versions were positively correlated, the evaluative capacity of the mo-MMSE version in measuring mental performance seems to be so good as that of the ad-MMSE.In cognitive evaluation through a modified test pro p o s e d to facilitate the resolution of questions, the possibility exists of false negative results.In the pre sent case, however, the introduced modifications w e re related rather to cultural meaning than to logic problems per se.Thus this possibility is re d uced taking account of individuals are facing actual problems similar to that experienced in their day life.F i n a l l y, in order to have a better compre h e nsion of the issue, the accuracy determination of mo-MMSE related to ad-MMSE 4 to test individuals' cognition handicaps will be further done.
