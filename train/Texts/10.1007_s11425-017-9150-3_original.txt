Invariant Einstein metrics on generalized Wallach spaces have been classified except SO(k + l + m)/SO(k) × SO(l) × SO(m). In this paper, we give a survey on the study of invariant Einstein metrics on generalized Wallach spaces, and prove that there are infinitely many spaces of the type SO(k + l + m)/SO(k) × SO(l) × SO(m) admitting exactly two, three, or four invariant Einstein metrics up to a homothety.

Introduction

This paper is devoted to the study of invariant Einstein metrics on generalized Wallach spaces, a remarkable class of compact homogeneous spaces which were introduced in [14]. They werecalled three-locally-symmetric spaces there, here we prefer to use the term generalized Wallach spaces as [17].

Let G a connected compact semisimple Lie group G and H its compact subgroup. Denote by g and h Lie algebras of G and H respectively. Assume that the compact homogeneous space G/H is almost effective, i. e. there is no non-trivial ideal of the Lie algebra g in h ⊂ g. Naturally, the Killing form B = B(· , ·) of g is negative definite. It follows that · , · := −B(· , ·) is a positive definite inner product on g. Let p be the · , · -orthogonal complement to h in g. Therefore p is Ad(H)-invariant (and ad(h)-invariant, in particular). The module p is naturally identified with the tangent space to G/H at the point eH. Every G-invariant Riemannian metric on G/H generates an Ad(H)-invariant inner product on p and vice versa. Hence, it is natural to identify invariant Riemannian metrics on G/H with Ad(H)-invariant inner products on p. Note that the Riemannian metric generated by the inner product · , · p is called Killing or standard. A compact homogeneous space G/H is called a generalized Wallach space if the module p is decomposed as a direct sum of three Ad(H)invariant irreducible modules pairwise orthogonal with respect to · , · , i. e. p = p 1 ⊕ p 2 ⊕ p 3 , such that [p i , p i ] ⊂ h for i ∈ {1, 2, 3}.

There are many examples of generalized Wallach spaces, such as the manifolds of complete flags in the complex, quaternionic, and Cayley projective planes: SU (3)/T max , Sp(3)/Sp(1)×Sp(1)×Sp (1), and F 4 /Spin (8), which are known as Wallach spaces; the various Kähler C-spaces SU (n 1 + n 2 + n 3 ) S U (n 1 ) × U (n 2 ) × U (n 3 ) , SO(2n)/U (1) × U (n − 1), and E 6 /U (1) × U (1) × Spin (8). The classification of generalized Wallach spaces G/H is obtained in [16], and the part for simple Lie groups G is also given in [8].

Theorem 1 ( [16]). A simply connected generalized Wallach space G/H is exactly one of the following cases: 1 so(k+l+m) so(k)⊕so(l)⊕so(m) kl km lm m 2(k+l+m−2) l 2(k+l+m−2) k 2(k+l+m −2) (1) G/H is a direct product of three irreducible symmetric spaces of compact type;

(2) The group G is simple and the pair (g, h) is one of the pairs in Table 1;

(3) G = F × F × F × F and H = diag(F ) ⊂ G for some connected simply connected compact simple Lie group F , with the following description on the Lie algebra level:
(g, h) = f ⊕ f ⊕ f ⊕ f, diag(f) = {(X, X, X, X) | X ∈ f} ,
where f is the Lie algebra of F , and (up to permutation) p 1 = {(X, X, −X, −X) | X ∈ f}, p 2 = {(X, −X, X, −X) | X ∈ f}, p 3 = {(X, −X, −X, X) | X ∈ f}.

The definitions and the properties of the numbers d i and a i , i = 1, 2, 3, in Table 1 are considered in the next section.

A Riemannian metric is Einstein if the Ricci curvature is a constant multiple of the metric. Various results on Einstein manifolds could be found in the book [7] of A.L. Besse and in more recent surveys [17,20,21].

There are a lot of studies on invariant Einstein metrics on generalized Wallach spaces. The invariant Einstein metrics on SU (3)/T max were classified in [10] and, on Sp(3)/Sp(1)× Sp(1)× Sp(1) and F 4 /Spin (8) in [18]. In each of these cases, there exist exactly four invariant Einstein metrics (up to proportionality). The invariant Einstein metrics on SU (n 1 + n 2 + n 3 ) S U (n 1 ) × U (n 2 ) × U (n 3 ) , SO(2n)/U (1)× U (n − 1), and E 6 /U (1)× U (1)× Spin(8) were classified in [11]. Each of these spaces admits four invariant Einstein metrics (up to scalar), one of which is Kähler for an appropriate complex structure on G/H. Another approach to SU (n 1 + n 2 + n 3 ) S U (n 1 ) × U (n 2 ) × U (n 3 ) was used in [4]. As a generalized Wallach space, the Lie group SU (2) H = {e} admits only one left-invariant Einstein metric which is a metric of constant curvature (see e. g. [7]). Recall that SU (2) is locally isomorphic to SO(3) = SO(3)/SO(1) × SO(1) × SO(1).

In [14], it was shown that every generalized Wallach space admits at least one invariant Einstein metric. Later in [13], a detailed study of invariant Einstein metrics was developed for all generalized Wallach spaces. In particular, it is proved that there are at most four Einstein metrics (up to homothety) for every such space. In [9], the authors classified all invariant Einstein metrics on Ledger-Obata spaces F 4 / diag(F ), hence, Einstein metrics of generalized Wallach spaces in the item 3) of Theorem 1. By the results from [8], [13] and [17], all invariant Einstein metrics on generalized Wallach spaces in the item 2) of Theorem 1 except SO(k + l + m)/SO(k) × SO(l) × SO(m) were classified.

In the recent papers [2,3], generalized Wallach spaces were studied from the point of view of the Ricci flow. Recall that singular points of the normalized Ricci flow for a homogeneous space G/H are exactly invariant Einstein metrics on G/H. It allows us to do a further study about invariant Einstein metrics on SO(k + l + m)/SO(k) × SO(l) × SO(m). More or less complete general picture we get from Theorem 7 in [3] (see also Theorem 6 in [2]) and [8]. Other helpful facts were obtained in [16,Section 6].

Our main results are the following two theorems.

Theorem 2. Suppose that k ≥ l ≥ m ≥ 1 and l ≥ 2. Then the number of invariant Einstein metrics on the space
G/H = SO(k + l + m)/SO(k) × SO(l) × SO(m) is 4 for m > √ 2k + 2l − 4 and 2 for m < √ k + l, up to a homothety.
Theorem 3. Let q be any number from the set {2, 3, 4}. Then there are infinitely many homogeneous spaces SO(k + l + m)/SO(k) × SO(l) × SO(m) that admit exactly q invariant Einstein metrics up to a homothety.

The proofs of these theorems are based on a deep study of some special subsets in (0, 1/2) 3 ⊂ R 3 related to the normalized Ricci flow on the spaces SO(k + l + m)/SO(k) × SO(l) × SO(m) and are obtained in the last section of this paper.


Description of Einstein metrics on generalized Wallach spaces

Every generalized Wallach space admits a 3-parameter family of invariant Riemannian metrics determined by inner products . It easy to see that d i ≥ 2A for any i = 1, 2, 3 (see [14]), hence (a 1 , a 2 , a 3 ) Table 1 for the value of these numbers for specific generalized Wallach spaces.
(· , ·) = x 1 · , · | p 1 + x 2 · , · | p 2 + x 3 · , · | p 3 , where x 1 , x 2 ,∈ [0, 1/2] 3 where a i = A d i for i ∈ {1, 2, 3}, see
Note that these constants completely determine some important properties of a generalized Wallach space G/H, e.g. the equation of the Ricci flow on G/H, see [2,3]. Note also that Einstein metrics (x 1 , x 2 , x 3 ) on a given generalized Wallach space are exactly the solutions of the following polynomial system:
(a 2 + a 3 )(a 1 x 2 2 + a 1 x 2 3 − x 2 x 3 ) + (a 2 x 2 + a 3 x 3 )x 1 − (a 1 a 2 + a 1 a 3 + 2a 2 a 3 )x 2 1 = 0, (a 1 + a 3 )(a 2 x 2 1 + a 2 x 2 3 − x 1 x 3 ) + (a 1 x 1 + a 3 x 3 )x 2 − (a 1 a 2 + 2a 1 a 3 + a 2 a 3 )x 2 2 = 0.(1)
Indeed, the Ricci curvature of the Riemannian metric corresponding to the inner product (· , ·) is Ric = r 1 (· , ·)| p 1 + r 2 (· , ·)| p 2 + r 3 (· , ·)| p 3 , where the principal Ricci curvatures r i satisfy the equation
r i = 1 2x i + a i 2 x i x j x k − x k x i x j − x j x i x k ,
where i, j, k ∈ {1, 2, 3} and i = j = k = i (see Lemma 2 in [14]). The metric under consideration is Einstein if and only if r 1 = r 2 = r 3 , that is equivalent to (1). More details could be found in [13] or in [2, Section 2].

Let Ω denote the algebraic surface in R 3 defined by the equation Q(a 1 , a 2 , a 3 ) = 0, where Q(a 1 , a 2 , a 3 ) = (2s 1 + 4s 3 − 1)(64s 5 1 − 64s 4 1 + 8s 3 1 + 12s 2 1 − 6s 1 + 1
+240s 3 s 2 1 − 240s 3 s 1 − 1536s 2 3 s 1 − 4096s 3 3 + 60s 3 + 768s 2 3 ) −8s 1 (2s 1 + 4s 3 − 1)(2s 1 − 32s 3 − 1)(10s 1 + 32s 3 − 5)s 2 (2) −16s 2 1 (13 − 52s 1 + 640s 3 s 1 + 1024s 2 3 − 320s 3 + 52s 2 1 )s 2 2 +64(2s 1 − 1)(2s 1 − 32s 3 − 1)s 3 2 + 2048s 1 (2s 1 − 1)s 4 2
and s 1 = a 1 + a 2 + a 3 , s 2 = a 1 a 2 + a 1 a 3 + a 2 a 3 , s 3 = a 1 a 2 a 3 . Obviously, Q(a 1 , a 2 , a 3 ) is a symmetric polynomial in a 1 , a 2 , a 3 of degree 12.

We recall some important properties of Ω, see [2] for details. The points (0, 0, 1/2), (0, 1/2, 0), and (1/2, 0, 0) are all vertices of the cube [0, 1/2] 3 , which are also points of Ω. For a 1 = 1/2 and a 2 , a 3 ∈ (0, 1/2], points of Ω form a curve homeomorphic to the interval [0, 1] with endpoints (1/2, 1/2, √ 2/4 ≈ 0.3535533905) and (1/2, √ 2/4 ≈ 0.3535533905, 1/2) and with the singular point (a cusp) at the point a 3 = a 2 = ( √ 5 − 1)/4 ≈ 0.3090169942. The same is also valid under the permutation a 1 → a 2 → a 3 → a 1 .

The plain s 1 = a 1 + a 2 + a 3 = 1/2 intersects the set Ω ∩ [0, 1/2] 3 exactly for points in the boundary of the triangle with the vertices (0, 0, 1/2), (0, 1/2, 0), and (1/2, 0, 0). For all other points in Ω ∩ (0, 1/2] 3 we have the inequality s 1 = a 1 + a 2 + a 3 > 1/2.

Note that (1/4, 1/4, 1/4) is the only point in Ω ∩ [0, 1/2] 3 satisfying s 1 = a 1 + a 2 + a 3 = 3/4. It turns out that the point (1/4, 1/4, 1/4) is a singular point of degree 3 of the algebraic surface Ω. This point is an elliptic umbilic (in the sense of Darboux) on the surface Ω. Now, we discuss a part of the surface Ω in the cube (0, 1/2) 3 . Obviously, Ω is invariant under the permutation a 1 → a 2 → a 3 → a 1 . It should be noted that the set (0, 1/2) 3 ∩ Ω is connected. There are three curves (so-called "edges") of singular points on Ω (i.e. points where ∇Q = 0): one of them has a parametric representation
a 1 = − 1 2 16t 3 −4t+1 8t 2 −1 , a 2 = a 3 = t,
and the others are defined by permutations of a i . The point (1/4, 1/4, 1/4) is a common point of these three curves. The part of Ω in (0, 1/2) 3 consists of three (pairwise isometric) "bubbles" spanned on every pair of "edges". Note also that in [5], the author found an explicit parameterization of the surface Ω. Another important fact is that the set (0, 1/2) 3 \ Ω has exactly three connected components. More precisely, we have Theorem 4 (Theorem 1 in [1]). The following assertions hold with respect to the standard topology of R 3 :

(1) The set (0, 1/2) 3 ∩ Ω is connected.

(2) The set (0, 1/2) 3 \ Ω consists of three conneted components.

Another proof of these theorem could be found in [6]. According to [2], we denote by O 1 , O 2 , and O 3 the components containing the points (1/6, 1/6, 1/6), (7/15, 7/15, 7/15), and (1/6,
1/4, 1/3) respectively. Note that Q(a 1 , a 2 , a 3 ) < 0 for (a 1 , a 2 , a 3 ) ∈ O 1 ∪ O 2 and Q(a 1 , a 2 , a 3 ) > 0 for (a 1 , a 2 , a 3 ) ∈ O 3 .
It is shown in [2], that the normalized Ricci flow for a generalized Wallach space with (a 1 , a 2 , a 3 ) ∈ (0, 1/2) 3 \ Ω has no degenerate singular point, as a planar dynamical system. The surface Ω was very important for the statement of Theorem 6 in [2] (see also Theorem 7 in [3]), which provides a general result about the type of the non-degenerate singular points of the normalized Ricci flow for a generalized Wallach space with given a 1 , a 2 , and a 3 . We recall it, taking in mind that singular points are exactly invariant Einstein metrics of fixed volume.

Theorem 5 (Theorem 6 in [2]). Assume that G/H is a generalized Wallach space such that
(a 1 , a 2 , a 3 ) ∈ O i .
(1) There are four singular points for i = 1 including one unstable node and three saddles;

(2) There are four singular points for i = 2 including one stable node and three saddles;

(3) There are two singular points for i = 3 which are saddles.

Now we describe the location of points (a 1 , a 2 , a 3 ) ∈ R 3 determined by generalized Wallach spaces in Theorem 1. Table 2 is to describe the region for every generalized Wallach space in Table 1. Table 2. The region for G/H in Table 1.
G/H (a 1 , a 2 , a 3 ) G/H (a 1 , a 2 , a 3 ) G/H (a 1 , a 2 , a 3 ) G/H (a 1 , a 2 , a 3 ) G/H (a 1 , a 2 , a 3 ) 1 O 1 ∪ O 3 ∪ Ω 2 O 1 3 O 1 4 O 1 5 O 3 6 O 3 7 O 1 8 O 3 9 O 1 10 O 3 11 O 2 12 O 3 13 O 2 14 O 3 15 O 1
In this table, the i-th generalized Wallach space means the one corresponding to the i-th pair in Table 1. Recall that every such space determines the point (a 1 , a 2 , a 3 ) and the points obtained with permutations of a 1 , a 2 , and a 3 .

The corresponding result for the spaces SO(k + l + m)/SO(k) × SO(l) × SO(m), where at least two of the numbers k, l, and m are greater than 1, was obtained in [16]. If at least two of the numbers k, l, and m are equal to 1, then the point (a 1 , a 2 , a 3 ) belongs to the boundary of the cube (0, 1/2) 3 . We will discuss it in details in the next section. It should be noted that these spaces are excepted from all other types of generalized Wallach spaces, because the corresponding triples (a 1 , a 2 , a 3 ) do not belong to only one region O i .

For
SU (k + l + m)/S U (k) × U (l) × U (m) , k ≥ l ≥ m ≥ 1, we have a 1 = k 2(k + l + m) , a 2 = l 2(k + l + m) , a 3 = m 2(k + l + m) ,
and a 1 + a 2 + a 3 = 1/2. It is clear that (a 1 , a 2 , a 3 ) belongs to O 1 . Moreover, the closure of the set of all such points coincides with the triangle in R 3 with the vertices (0, 0, 1/2), (0, 1/2, 0), and (1/2, 0, 0). The last assertion easily follows from considering the barycentric coordinates in this triangle. For these spaces we have simple explicit expressions for Einstein metrics, see [4,11,13].
For Sp(k + l + m)/Sp(k) × Sp(l) × Sp(m), k ≥ l ≥ m ≥ 1, we have a 1 = k 2(k + l + m + 1) , a 2 = l 2(k + l + m + 1) , a 3 = m 2(k + l + m + 1) ,
and a 1 + a 2 + a 3 < 1/2. Hence (a 1 , a 2 , a 3 ) also belongs to O 1 . Note that the original proof in [13] of the fact that the spaces Sp(k + l + m)/Sp(k) × Sp(l) × Sp(m) admits exactly four Einstein invariant metric (up to a homothety) is very complicated and is based on the calculation of the Sturm's sequence of polynomials.

For the others, we may use one more simple observation: For a 1 = a 2 = a 3 =: a, the point (a 1 , a 2 , a 3 ) is in O 1 (respectively, O 2 ), if a < 1/4 (respectively, a > 1/4). Direct computations show that (a 1 , a 2 , a 3 ) ∈ O 1 for the spaces corresponding to lines 4, 7, 9, and 15 of Table 1, (a 1 , a 2 , a 3 ) ∈ O 3 for the spaces corresponding to lines 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 14 of Table 1, and (a 1 , a 2 , a 3 ) ∈ O 2 for the spaces corresponding to the lines 11 and 13 of Table 1.

Theorem 5 and Table 2 give us the explicit number of Einstein invariant metrics (up to a homothety) on every generalized Wallach space G/H with simple G except SO(k + l + m)/SO(k) × SO(l) × SO(m). If G/H is a symmetric space which is a product of three irreducible symmetric spaces, then we get A = 0 and (a 1 , a 2 , a 3 ) = (0, 0, 0). Note also that the equality a 1 = a 2 = a 3 = 1/4 holds for every space (F × F × F × F )/ diag(F ), as well as for the space SO(6)/SO(2) 3 (see details in [16]). Recall that the point (1/4, 1/4, 1/4) is an elliptic umbilic on the surface Ω.

Remark 2. The isotropy representation for the space F 4 / diag(F ), that is a Ledger-Obata space (see [9,12,15]), can be decomposed into the sum of 3 pairwise isomorphic Ad(diag(F ))-modules which may not coincides with p i , i = 1, 2, 3, as in Theorem 1, see [15]. The structure of invariant metrics on F k / diag(F ) was described in [15]. Note that for k = 2 we get irreducible symmetric spaces. For k = 3 and k = 4, the classification of invariant Einstein metrics on the spaces F k / diag(F ) was obtained in [15] and [9] respectively, but for k ≥ 5 this problem is open.


The spaces SO(k + l + m)/SO(k) × SO(l) × SO(m)

For the space SO(k + l + m)/SO(k) × SO(l) × SO(m), k ≥ l ≥ m ≥ 1, we have
a 1 = k 2(k + l + m − 2) , a 2 = l 2(k + l + m − 2) , a 3 = m 2(k + l + m − 2)
.

If l = m = 1, then we get a 1 = 1/2 and a 2 = a 3 = 1 2k . Hence, (a 1 , a 2 , a 3 ) ∈ (0, 1/2) 3 , but (a 1 , a 2 , a 3 ) ∈ (0, 1/2] 3 . It is easy to check with using of (1) that such space has exactly one Einstein invariant metrics up to a homothety: (x 1 , x 2 , x 3 ) = (k + 1, k + 1, 2k).

In what follows, we assume that l ≥ 2. Therefore, k ≥ l ≥ 2 and k + l + m ≥ 5. It is proved in [16,Section 6] that (a 1 , a 2 , a 3 a 2 , a 3 ) < 0, Q(a 1 , a 2 , a 3 ) > 0, or Q(a 1 , a 2 , a 3 ) = 0 respectively. In the following, we will give some details.
) ∈ O 1 ∪ O 3 ∪ Ω in this case. Moreover, (a 1 , a 2 , a 3 ) belongs to O 1 , O 3 , or Ω, if Q(a 1 ,
Note that a 1 + a 2 + a 3 = k+l+m 2(k+l+m−2) . Since the function x → x 2(x−2) =: g(x) decreases for x > 2, we know that a 1 + a 2 + a 3 ≤ 3/4 = g(6) holds for any k, l, m satisfying k + m + l ≥ 6. If k + m + l = 6, then we have two spaces SO(6)/SO(2) 3 and SO(6)/SO(3) × SO(2) × SO(1) with a 1 + a 2 + a 3 = 3/4. Recall that the plane a 1 + a 2 + a 3 = 3/4 intersects the surface Ω ∩ (0, 1/2) 3 exactly in the point (1/4, 1/4, 1/4) corresponding to the first space SO(6)/SO(2) 3 . The space SO(6)/SO(2) 3 admits only standard Einstein metric, which is highly degenerate as a singular point of the normalized Ricci flow, see details in [2] and [3]. For the space SO (6) If k + m + l ≥ 7, we know a 1 + a 2 + a 3 ≤ 7/10 = g(7) < 3/4. It follows that (a 1 , a 2 , a 3 ) ∈ O 2 . For small values of k ≥ l ≥ m, we have the following Table.   Table 3. The region for small (k, l, m).

Define a polynomial G(k, l, m) in k, l, m by G(k, l, m)

, m 2(k + l + m − 2)

.

It is clear that G(k, l, m) is a symmetric (with respect to k, l and m) polynomial of degree 12. Let t 1 = k + l + m, t 2 = kl + km + lm, and t 3 = klm. Then we have
G(k, l, m) = H(t 1 , t 2 , t 3 ),(4)
where
H(t 1 , t 2 , t 3 ) = 16(t 1 − 2) 2 + 4t 3 1024t 5 1 (t 1 − 2) 4 − 2048t 4 1 (t 1 − 2) 5 + 512t 3 1 (t 1 − 2) 6 +1536t 2 1 (t 1 − 2) 7 − 1536t 1 (t 1 − 2) 8 + 512(t 1 − 2) 9 + 3840t 3 t 2 1 (t 1 − 2) 4 − 4096t 3 3 −7680t 3 t 1 (t 1 − 2) 5 − 6144t 2 3 t 1 (t 1 − 2) 2 + 3840t 3 (t 1 − 2) 6 + 6144t 2 3 (t 1 − 2) 3 −8t 1 16(t 1 − 2) 2 + 4t 3 16(t 1 − 2) 2 − 32t 3 80(t 1 − 2) 2 + 32t 3 t 2 (5) −16t 2 1 832(t 1 − 2) 6 − 1664t 1 (t 1 − 2) 5 + 2560t 3 t 1 (t 1 − 2) 2 +1024t 2 3 − 2560t 3 (t 1 − 2) 3 + 832t 2 1 (t 1 − 2) 4 t 2 2 +1024(t 1 − 2) 2 16(t 1 − 2) 2 − 32t 3 t 3 2 + 32768t 1 t 4 2 (t 1 − 2) 2 .
We see that the above Diophantine equation G(k, l, m) = 0 is very complicated. Clearly,
Lemma 1. The point (a 1 , a 2 , a 3 ) = k 2(k+l+m−2) , l 2(k+l+m−2) , m 2(k+l+m−2) is in O 1 , O 3 , or Ω, if G(k, l, m) < 0, G(k, l, m) > 0, or G(k, l, m) = 0 respectively.

It follows that

Proposition 1. If G(k, l, m) < 0 (respectively, > 0), then SO(k + l + m)/SO(k) × SO(l) × SO(m) admits four (respectively, two) invariant Einstein metrics.


A further study on SO(k + l + m)/SO(k) × SO(l) × SO(m)

In this section, we give a further study on SO(k + l + m)/SO(k) × SO(l) × SO(m) satisfying k ≥ l ≥ m and l ≥ 2. In particular we will prove Theorem 2 and Theorem 3. For this goal we get some more detailed information on some special sets in (0, 1/2) 3 related to the normalized Ricci flows on the spaces SO(k + l + m)/SO(k) × SO(l) × SO(m). In particular we prove In this section, we will assume that k + m + l ≥ 7 (the cases k + m + l < 7 are discussed in the previous section).

Let us fix some h ∈ (1/2, 3/4). If a 1 + a 2 + a 3 = h and there exist i, j ∈ {1, 2, 3} with a i = a j , then the equation Q(a 1 , a 2 , a 3 ) = 0 is
(4x − 1 − 2h)(16x 2 − (24h − 4)x + 8h 2 − 4h + 1)(16x 3 − 16hx 2 + 2h − 1) 3 = 0,(6)
where a i = a j = x, a k = h − 2x, {i, j, k} = {1, 2, 3}. This equation has only two (distinct) roots in the interval [0, h/2]. One root is
x = x(h) = 6h − 1 − √ 4h 2 + 4h − 3 8(7)
and the other one (that has multiplicity 3) is x = x(h). Here, x is a root of the equation .
f (x) := 16x 3 − 16hx 2 + 2h − 1 = 0,(8)Note that f (x) decreases for x ∈ [0, 2h/3]. It is easy to prove that f ( x) < 0 = f ( x), hence x < x.
We need the following property of the surface Ω and the function Q(a 1 , a 2 , a 3 ) (see (2)).  Figure 1). In order to show the evolutions of these types of triangles, we reproduced the pictures in the planes π(h) with four values of the parameter h (see Figure 2 and Figure 3).  Proof. Recall that Ω = {(a 1 , a 2 , a 3 ) ∈ R 3 | Q(a 1 , a 2 , a 3 ) = 0}. The intersection of Ω ∩ [0, 1/2] 3 with the plane π(h) = {(a 1 , a 2 , a 3 ) | a 1 + a 2 + a 3 = h} is compact and is contained in (0, 1/2) 3 . Clear that (h/3, h/3, h/3) ∈ Ω, therefore, IT (h) is non-degenerate. Clear that IT (h) ∩ I(h) is non-empty. If a point (a 1 , a 2 , a 3 ) ∈ IT (h) ∩ I(h), then either (a 1 , a 2 , a 3 ) is a vertex of IT (h) (and, consequently, of I(h)) or the gradient ∇Q(a 1 , a 2 , a 3 ) is orthogonal to one of the vectors (1, −1, 0), (1, 0, −1), (0, 1, −1) (because the sides of IT (h) are parallel to these vectors). In the second case two components of ∇Q(a 1 , a 2 , a 3 ) are coincide and we have (a 1 − a 2 )(a 1 − a 3 )(a 2 − a 3 ) = 0 by Lemma 2. The same we have in the first case, since the vertices are of singular points on Ω (i.e. points where ∇Q = 0). By the above discussion on x(h) and x(h) (see (7) and (8)), we see that (up to a permutation of coordinates) either (a 1 , a 2 , Hence, two components of ∇Q(a 1 , a 2 , a 3 ) are coincide and we have (a 1 − a 2 )(a 1 − a 3 )(a 2 − a 3 ) = 0 by Lemma 2. By the above discussion on x(h) and x(h), we see that (up to a permutation of coordinates) either (a 1 , a 2 , a 3 ) = ( x, x, h − 2 x) or (a 1 , a 2 , a 3 ) = ( x, x, h − 2 x). But both these points are in ST (h). This contradiction proves the second assertion of the lemma.
Lemma 2. Suppose that a point (a 1 , a 2 , a 3 ) ∈ (0, 1/2) 3 is such that Q(a 1 , a 2 , a 3 ) = 0 and ∂Q ∂a i (a 1 , a 2 , a 3 ) = ∂Q ∂a j (a 1 , a 2 , a 3 ), i = j, i, j ∈ {1, 2, 3}. Then (a 1 − a 2 )(a 1 − a 3 )(a 2 −aa 3 ) = ( x, x, h − 2 x) or (a 1 , a 2 , a 3 ) = ( x, x, h − 2 x).
Lemma 3 and simple arguments about convex hulls of triples of points imply
Lemma 4. Let (a 1 , a 2 , a 3 ) ∈ (0, 1/2) 3 satisfying a 1 + a 2 + a 3 = h ∈ (1/2, 3/4). (1) If a i > h − 2 x(h) for any i = 1, 2, 3, then (a 1 , a 2 , a 3 ) ∈ IT (h) ⊂ O 1 . (2) If there exists some i ∈ {1, 2, 3} such that a i < x(h), then (a 1 , a 2 , a 3 ) ∈ (0, 1/2) 3 ∩ π(h) \ ST (h) ⊂ O 3 .
In what follows, we use the quantity
h 0 := k + l + m 2(k + l + m − 2)
.

Clear, h 0 = a 1 + a 2 + a 3 for (a 1 , a 2 , a 3 ) = k 2(k+l+m−2) , l 2(k+l+m−2) , m 2(k+l+m−2) . Recall that 1/2 < h 0 ≤ 7/10 < 3/4 for k + m + l ≥ 7.

Proposition 2. If k ≥ l ≥ m, l ≥ 2, k + m + l ≥ 7, and k + l
4(k + l + m − 2) < x(h 0 ),(10)
then (a 1 , a 2 , a 3 ) ∈ O 1 .

Proof. Note that the inequality (10)  ≈ 0, 2071067810 < x(1/2) = x(3/4) = 1/4. By Proposition 2, we have the following corollary.
Corollary 1. If k ≥ l ≥ m, l ≥ 2, k + m + l ≥ 7, and k + l 4(k + l + m − 2) < √ 2 − 1 2 ,(11)
then (a 1 , a 2 , a 3 ) ∈ O 1 .
Proposition 3. If k ≥ l ≥ m, l ≥ 2, k + m + l ≥ 7, and m > √ 2k + 2l − 4, then (a 1 , a 2 , a 3 ) ∈ O 1 . Proof. Since the function x → 16x 2 − (24h − 4)x + 8h 2 − 4h + 1 decreases on [0, h/2] for h ∈ [1/2, 3/4] (since 24h − 4 ≥ 16h)
, we know that the inequality (10) is equivalent to
16 k + l 4(k + l + m − 2) 2 − (24h 0 − 4) k + l 4(k + l + m − 2) + 8h 2 0 − 4h 0 + 1 > 0,
which is equivalent to m 2 − 2k − 2l + 4 > 0. Equivalently, m > √ 2k + 2l − 4. Now, it suffices to apply Proposition 2. 
Proposition 4. If k ≥ l ≥ m, l ≥ 2, k + m + l ≥ 7, and m 2(k + l + m − 2) < x(h 0 ),(12)then (a 1 , a 2 , a 3 ) ∈ O 3 .
Proof. Note that the inequality (12) is equivalent to a 3 = m 2(k+l+m−2) < x(h 0 ). It implies that (a 1 , a 2 , a 3 ) ∈ O 3 by Lemma 4. Proof. Obviously, if k = l = m = 2, the point (a 1 , a 2 , a 3 ) is a vertex of I(3/4) (because it is an unique point in this degenerate triangle). On the other hand, assume that k ≥ l ≥ m and (a 1 , a 2 , a 3 ) is a vertex of I(h 0 ). Clearly (a 1 , a 2 , a 3 ) = (h 0 − 2 x, x, x). Hence, m = l and k 2 − (l − 2) 2 k − l 3 + 4l 2 − 8l + 4 = 0. It is easy to see that k = l = 2 since the discriminant is l 2 ((l − 2) 2 + 4). Proposition 6. If k ≥ l ≥ m, l ≥ 2, k + m + l ≥ 7, and
m < 1 + √ k + l k + l − 2 k + l − 1 , then (a 1 , a 2 , a 3 ) ∈ O 3 .
Proof. Recall that f (x) decreases for x ∈ [0, 2h/3]. Since m 2(k+l+m−2) ≤ 1 3 h 0 = k+l+m 6(k+l+m−2) and x(h 0 ) ≤ h 0 /3, the inequality (12) is equivalent to f m 2(k+l+m−2) > 0, i.e.
(k + l − 1)m 2 − 2(k + l − 2)m − k 2 − 2kl − l 2 + 4k + 4l − 4 < 0.
That is, m < 1 + √ k + l k+l−2 k+l−1 . Note that the function η(x) = 1 + √ x x−2 x−1 increases for x > 1 and η(3) ≈ 1.366, η(4) = 2, η(5) ≈ 2.427, η(6) ≈ 2.759, η(7) ≈ 3.038. This implies
Corollary 2. If k ≥ l ≥ m, l ≥ 2, and k + m + l ≥ 7, then (a 1 , a 2 , a 3 ) ∈ O 3 if (1) m = 1;
(2) m = 2 and k + l ≥ 5;

(3) m = 3 and k + l ≥ 7.

Since √ x ≤ 1 + √ x x−2 x−1 for x ≥ 4, we have the following corollary from Proposition 6. Corollary 3. If k ≥ l ≥ m, l ≥ 2, k + m + l ≥ 7, and m < √ k + l,
then (a 1 , a 2 , a 3 ) ∈ O 3 .
Now, we are ready to prove Theorem 2, Theorem 3, and Theorem 6. Proof of Theorem 2. From Proposition 3 and Corollary 3 we get that (a 1 , a 2 , a 3 ) ∈ O 1 for m > √ 2k + 2l − 4 and (a 1 , a 2 , a 3 ) ∈ O 3 for m < √ k + l (all cases with k + m + l < 7 are discussed in the previous section). Now, it suffices to apply Theorem 5, taking in mind that singular points for the normalized Ricci flow are exactly invariant Einstein metrics of fixed volume.

Proof of Theorem 6. For (k, l, m) = (t 2 + 1, t 2 + 1, 2t), where t ∈ N, we get
(a 1 , a 2 , a 3 ) = k 2(k + l + m − 2) , l 2(k + l + m − 2)
, m 2(k + l + m − 2) = t 2 + 1 4t(t + 1)

, t 2 + 1 4t(t + 1) , 1 2(t + 1)

∈ Ω by (2) and direct calculations. Alternatively, it suffices to check that G(t 2 + 1, t 2 + 1, 2t) = 0, see (4). Then Theorem 6 follows from this observation, Proposition 3, and Corollary 3.


Remark 5.

It is easy to check using of (1) that SO 2(t 2 + t + 1) /SO(t 2 + 1)× SO(t 2 + 1)× SO(2t), the generalized Wallach space with (a 1 , a 2 , a 3 ) = t 2 +1 4t(t+1) , t 2 +1 4t(t+1) , 1 2(t+1) , has exactly three Einstein metrics (up to constant multiple) for t ≥ 2, whereas SO(6)/SO(2) × SO(2) × SO(2) has unique

We should have R 1 (s, t) = 0. Note that a 3 = s = t = a 2 is impossible. It is easy to see that s 3 t(2t − 1) 2 (2s − 1) 4 (t + s) 2 > 0, 8s 2 t + 8st 2 + 8s 2 + 20st + 8t 2 + 12s + 12t + 5 > 0, 64s 2 t + 64st 2 − 32s 2 − 80st − 32t 2 + 24s + 24t − 5 < 0 for (t, s) ∈ (0, 1/2) × (0, 1/2). It is not difficult to show also that L > 0 for (t, s) ∈ (0, 1/2) × (0, 1/2) (the minimal value of L on [0, 1/2] × [0, 1/2] is 0 and it is attained only at the points (0, 0), (0, 1/2), (1/2, 0), and (1/2, 1/2)). Therefore, we get either 2t + 2s = 1 or 16s 3 + 16s 2 t − 4s − 2t + 1 = 0.

Suppose that s = 1/2 − t, t ∈ (0, 1/2). Then Q = 4a 1 · Q c1 , where Q c1 = −1024a 5 1 s 4 + 2048a 3 1 s 6 − 1024a 1 s 8 + 1024a 5 1 s 3 − 512a 4 1 s 4 −3072a 3 1 s 5 + 2048a 1 s 7 + 512s 8 + 320a 5 1 s 2 + 512a 4 1 s 3 + 1152a 3 1 s 4 −1984a 1 s 6 − 1024s 7 − 288a 5 1 s − 192a 4 1 s 2 + 128a 3 1 s 3 + 448a 2 1 s 4 + 1184a 1 s 5 +768s 6 + 44a 5 1 + 32a 4 1 s − 328a 3 1 s 2 − 448a 2 1 s 3 − 452a 1 s 4 − 256s 5 − 4a 4 1 +116a 3 1 s + 196a 2 1 s 2 + 108a 1 s 3 + 32s 4 − 13a 3 1 − 42a 2 1 s − 13a 1 s 2 + 4a 2 1 . Q 12 = 8a 1 (2s + 2a 1 − 1) · Q 12c1 , where Q 12c1 = −1024a 4 1 s 4 + 1024a 3 1 s 5 + 1024a 2 1 s 6 − 1024a 1 s 7 + 1536a 4 1 s 3 − 1792a 3 1 s 4 −2304a 2 1 s 5 + 1792a 1 s 6 + 768s 7 + 128a 4 1 s 2 + 640a 3 1 s 3 + 1536a 2 1 s 4 − 1152a 1 s 5 −1664s 6 − 464a 4 1 s − 48a 3 1 s 2 − 80a 2 1 s 3 + 816a 1 s 4 + 1184s 5 + 76a 4 1 − 36a 3 1 s −396a 2 1 s 2 − 476a 1 s 3 − 320s 4 + 4a 3 1 + 192a 2 1 s + 124a 1 s 2 + 24s 3 − 23a 2 1 − 11a 1 s. If 2s + 2a 1 − 1 = 0, then a 1 = t = a 2 , that is impossible. Let us consider the resultant R 2 of the polynomials Q c1 and Q 12c1 with respect to a 1 . Direct computations implies R 2 = R 2 (s) = −2048 s 6 (8s 2 − 4s − 13)(2s − 1) 4 (4s − 1) 10 ×(4096s 6 − 6144s 5 − 768s 4 + 3328s 3 − 192s 2 − 384s + 91) 3 .

Let us consider the resultant R 3 of the polynomials Q c2 and Q 12c2 with respect to a 1 . Direct computations implies R 3 = R 3 (s) = 442368 s 4 (16s 3 − 4s + 1)(64s 4 − 48s 3 − 80s 2 + 68s − 13)(2s + 1) 2 ×(4s 2 + 2s − 1) 2 (64s 4 − 32s 2 + 8s − 1) 2 (4s − 1) 5 (2s − 1) 8 (8s 2 − 1) 12 · M , where M = 67108864s 16 − 73400320s 14 + 6291456s 13 + 34799616s 12 − 6029312s 11 −8978432s 10 + 2510848s 9 + 1233920s 8 − 570368s 7 − 42496s 6 + 66496s 5 −11664s 4 − 1952s 3 + 1184s 2 − 204s + 13.

It is easy to see that R 3 (s) = 0 for s ∈ 0, if and only if s = 1/4. But in this case we have a 2 = t = 1/4 = s = a 3 that is impossible. Lemma 2 is completely proved.


x 3 are positive real numbers. Denote by d i the dimension of p i . Let e j i be an orthonormal basis in p i with respect to · , · for i = 1, 2, 3 and 1 ≤ j ≤ d i = dim(p i ). α, β, and γ range from 1 to d i , d j , and d k respectively. Clearly [ijk] are symmetric in all three indices by the bi-invariance of · , · . Here we also have [ijk] = 0 if two indices coincide. Let A := [123]

Remark 1 .
1Note that the above examples satisfying (a 1 , a 2 , a 3 ) ∈ O 2 are interesting, since they give an affirmative answer to the question of Prof. Christoph Böhm on the existence of specific examples of generalized Wallach spaces with this property.

For
k + m + l ≤ 5 we should check only the space SO(5)/SO(2) × SO(2) × SO(1) with a 1 = a 2 = 1/3 and a 3 = 1/6. It is easy to see that the point (1/3, 1/3, 1/6) is in O 3 , because the inequalities a i ≥ 1/4, i = 1, 2, 3 hold for any points in O 2 .

It should be noted that the discriminant of the polynomial f (x) is D := 256(2h − 1)(64h 3 − 54h + 27) and D > 0 for h ∈ (1/2, 3/4). Hence the equation(8)has three real roots. The first one is in (−∞, 0), the second one is in (0, h/3), and the third one is in (h/2, ∞)


3 ) = 0. Note that this lemma imply (in particular) that all singular points (a 1 , a 2 , a 3 ) of the surface Ω = {(a 1 , a 2 , a 3 ) ∈ R 3 | Q(a 1 , a 2 , a 3 ) = 0} (i. e. points where ∇Q = 0) in (0, 1/2) 3 are such that (a 1 − a 2 )(a 1 − a 3 )(a 2 − a 3 ) = 0. The proof of Lemma 2 is quite technical and could be found in Appendix.For h ∈ [1/2, 3/4], we denote by I(h) the intersection of the surface Ω ∩ [0, 1/2] 3 with the plane π(h) := {(a 1 , a 2 , a 3 ) | a 1 + a 2 + a 3 = h}. Clear that I(3/4) is the point (1/4, 1/4, 1, 4) and I(1/2) is the boundary of the triangle with the vertices (0, 0, 1/2), (0, 1/2, 0) and (1/2, 0, 0). I(h). For h ∈ [1/2, 3/4), I(h) contains exactly one point on every singular "edge" of Ω (I(3/4) contains one common point of all "edges"). We call these special three points (namely, ( x, x, h−2 x), ( x, h−2 x, x), and (h − 2 x, x, x)) as vertices of I(h), that is a "curvilinear triangle". Obviously, I(h) is invariant under the group of symmetry of a usual triangle with the same vertices. Clear that I(h) is compact and it is contained in (0, 1/2) 3 for all h ∈ (1/2, 3/4]. We are not going to emphasize the geometry of I(h) in details, because all we need for our purposes is Lemma 3 below.Denote by ST (h) the usual triangle (in the plane π(h)) with the same vertices as I(h) has. Now, let IT (h) be a maximal usual triangle in I(h) (in the plane π(h), in particular) with sides parallel to sides of the triangle ST (h) (it has the same symmetry group as I(h) has).Clearly, ST (1/2) = IT (1/2) = I(1/2), ST (3/4) = IT (3/4) = I(3/4) = {(1/4, 1/4, 1/4)}, and it could be demonstrated that IT (h) I(h) ST (h) for h ∈ (1/2, 3/4) (see

Clear that the triangle with the vertices ( x, x, h − 2 x), ( x, h − 2 x, x), and (h − 2 x, x, x) are in the interior of the triangle ST (h). Therefore, (a 1 , a 2 , a 3 ) = ( x, x, h − 2 x), and we prove the the first assertion of the lemma. For the second assertion, suppose that I(h) ⊂ ST (h). In the plane π(h), consider a minimal triangle M T (h) with sides parallel to the sides of ST (h) and I(h) ⊂ M T (h). Clearly ST (h) is in the interior of M T (h). There is a point (a 1 , a 2 , a 3 ) ∈ I(h) in the interior of some side of M T (h).

3Note that k+l 4(k+l+m−2) ≤ x(h 0 ) implies (a 1 , a 2 , a 3 ) ∈ O 1 ∪ Ω. Here (a 1 , a 2 , a 3 ) ∈ Ω, if and only if l = k, a 3 = m 2(2k+m−2) = h 0 − 2 x(h 0 ), a 1 = a 2 = k 2(2k+m−2) = x(h 0 ). This property is fulfilled if and only if (k, l, m) = (t 2 + 1, t 2 + 1, 2t), where 3 ≤ t ∈ Z. Note that m = √ 2k + 2l − 4 for this case.

Remark 4 .
4Note that m 2(k+l+m−2) ≤ x(h 0 ) implies (a 1 , a 2 , a 3 ) ∈ O 3 ∪ Ω, and (a 1 , a 2 , a 3 ) ∈ Ω if and only if (a 1 , a 2 , a 3 ) is a vertex of I(h 0 ). Proposition 5. The point (a 1 , a 2 , a 3 ) = k 2(k+l+m−2) , l 2(k+l+m−2) , m 2(k+l+m−2) is a vertex of I(h 0 ) if and only if k = l = m = 2.

Acknowlegment. The authors are grateful to the referees for helpful comments and suggestions that improved the presentation of this paper.(up to a homothety) Einstein invariant metric. Indeed, for the case a 1 = a 2 , subtracting the second equation by the first equation in (1), we haveadding the first equation into the second equation in (1), we haveBy the equation(13), we havePutting x 1 = x 2 and (a 1 , a 2 , a 3 ) = t 2 +1 4t(t+1) , t 2 +1 4t(t+1) , 1 2(t+1) into the equation(14), we haveThat is, we have the solutionup to a homothety. Putting 2a 1 (x 1 + x 2 ) = x 3 and (a 1 , a 2 , a 3 ) =into the equation(14), we have the following solutionsSee details in[13]. It is clear that the second and the third metrics are isometric (in fact, one need only to permute x 1 and x 2 ). Note that lim t→∞ x 3x 1 is equal to 2, 2/3, and 2 for these three families, whereas lim t→∞ x 3x 2 is equal to 2, 2, and 2/3 respectively.Proof of Theorem 3. The proof for q = 2 and q = 4 follows directly from Theorem 2. The proof for q = 3 follows from Remark 5: every space SO 2(t 2 +t+1) /SO(t 2 +1)×SO(t 2 +1)×SO(2t) with t ≥ 2 has exactly three invariant Einstein metrics up to a homothety.Finally, we propose the following interesting open questions.AppendixHere we consider a detailed proof of Lemma 2. All computations below were produced using Maple (of course, it is possible to apply any other system of symbolic computations).Without loss of generality, we assume that i = 1 and j = 2. Suppose that the lemma is not true, i. e. (a 1 − a 2 )(a 1 − a 3 )(a 2 − a 3 ) = 0.Direct calculations (see see(2)) show that ∂Q1 a 2 3 − 528a 2 1 a 3 2 − 96a 2 1 a 2 2 a 3 + 864a 2 1 a 2 a 2 3 + 528a 2 1 a 3 3 − 208a 1 a 4 2 − 272a 1 a 3 2 a 3 +864a 1 a 2 2 a 2 3 + 1184a 1 a 2 a 3 3 + 352a 1 a 4 3 − 176a 4 2 a 3 + 32a 3 2 a 2 3 + 528a 2 2 a 3 3 + 352a 2 a 4 3 + 32a 5 3 +40a 4 1 + 212a 3 1 a 2 + 148a 3 1 a 3 + 320a 2 1 a 2 2 + 284a 2 1 a 2 a 3 + 20a 2 1 a 2 3 + 212a 1 a 3 2 + 284a 1 a 2 2 a 3 +8a 1 a 2 a 2 3 − 88a 1 a 3 3 + 40a 4 2 + 148a 3 2 a 3 + 20a 2 2 a 2By the condition of the lemma we have Q(a 1 , a 2 , a 3 ) = Q 12 (a 1 , a 2 , a 3 ) = 0. Let us consider the resultant R 1 of the polynomials Q and Q 12 with respect to a 1 . By direct computations we have×(16s 3 + 16s 2 t − 4s − 2t + 1) 3 (8s 2 t + 8st 2 + 8s 2 + 20st + 8t 2 + 12s + 12t + 5)It is easy to check that 8s 2 −4s−13 < 0 and 4096s 6 −6144s 5 −768s 4 +3328s 3 −192s 2 −384s+91 > 0 for s ∈ (0, 1/2). If s = 1/4, then Q c1 = 1 128 (2a 1 + 1)(4a 1 − 1) 4 , hence, a 1 = 1/4 = s = a 3 . Therefore, we have no critical points with pairwise distinct a 1 , a 2 , a 3 in this case. Now, suppose that 16s 3 + 16s 2 t − 4s − 2t + 1 = 16s 3 − 4s + 1 − 2t(1 − 8s 2 ) = 0. Then we get t = 1−4s+16s32(1−8s 2 ) , where s ∈ 0,≈ 0.3090169942 due to t ∈ (0, 1/2). Under the above substitution we get that Q = 4(a 1 −s) 2 (8s 2 −1) 6 · Q c2 , whereWe also have Q 12 = 8(a 1 −s)(16a 1 s 2 +16s 3 −2a 1 −4s+1)41 s 10 − 14680064a 2 1 s 12 + 1048576a 1 s 13 +5767168s 14 + 5799936a 4 1 s 9 − 8912896a 3 1 s 10 − 1277952a 2 1 s 11 + 7274496a 1 s 12 −2883584s 13 − 4472832a 4 1 s 8 + 1343488a 3 1 s 9 + 6832128a 2 1 s 10 − 1376256a 1 s 11 −2326528s 12 − 761856a 4 1 s 7 + 2777088a 3 1 s 8 − 1630208a 2 1 s 9 − 1875968a 1 s 10 + 1712128s 11 +1064960a 4 1 s 6 − 983040a 3 1 s 7 − 1155072a 2 1 s 8 + 458752a 1 s 9 + 172032s 10 − 61440a 4 1 s 5 −282624a 3 1 s 6 + 745472a 2 1 s 7 + 223232a 1 s 8 − 334336s 9 − 108032a 4 1 s 4 + 210432a 3 1 s 5 −70656a 2 1 s 6 − 87040a 1 s 7 + 34560s 8 + 20224a 4 1 s 3 − 22144a 3 1 s 4 − 91648a 2 1 s 5 + 6400a 1 s 6 +24960s 7 + 3200a 4 1 s 2 − 10880a 3 1 s 3 + 38720a 2 1 s 4 + 3840a 1 s 5 − 3776s 6 − 1128a 4 1 s +3520a 3 1 s 2 − 2552a 2 1 s 3 − 4112a 1 s 4 − 1776s 5 + 76a 4 1 − 336a 3 1 s − 1620a 2 1 s 2 +1736a 1 s 3 + 576s 4 + 4a31 + 370a 2 1 s − 320a 1 s 2 − 54s 3 − 23a 2 1 + 22a 1 s + s 2 .The equality 16a 1 s 2 + 16s 3 − 2a 1 − 4s + 1 = 0 implies a 1 = t = a 2 and a 1 − s implies a 1 = s = a 3 , that is impossible.
