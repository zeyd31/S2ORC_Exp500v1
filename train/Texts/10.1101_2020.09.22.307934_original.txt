21Background: The influence of farming on plant, animal and microbial biodiversity has been carefully 22 studied and much debated. Here, we compare an isolate-based study of 196 Rhizobium strains to 23 amplicon-based MAUI-seq analysis of rhizobia from 17,000 white clover root nodules. We use these 24 data to investigate the influence of soil properties, geographic distance, and field management on 25Rhizobium nodule populations. 26 27 Results: Overall, there was good agreement between the two approaches and the precise allele 28 frequency estimates from the large-scale MAUI-seq amplicon data allowed detailed comparisons of 29 rhizobium populations between individual plots and fields. A few specific chromosomal core-gene 30 alleles were significantly correlated with soil clay content, and core-gene allele profiles became 31 increasingly distinct with geographic distance. Field management was associated with striking 32 differences in Rhizobium diversity, where organic fields showed significantly higher diversity levels than 33 conventionally managed trials. 34 35Conclusions:Our results indicate that MAUI-seq is suitable and robust for assessing nodule Rhizobium 36 diversity. We further observe possible profound effects of field management on microbial diversity, 37 which could impact plant health and productivity and warrant further investigation. 38

Understanding the microbial variability within and between fields, and which factors influence the 45 number or diversity of microbes, is necessary to understand how to best optimise or work with the 46 microbiome. The increase in genetic diversity over distance for microorganisms has been shown at 47 scales ranging from metres to 100 kilometres (Whitaker et al., 2003;Ramette & Tiedje, 2007). This 48 effect can be explained by sampling a wide range of conditions or by isolation-by-distance, first 49 described in aquatic Sulfolobus, and since then verified in multiple species (Whitaker et al., 2003; and recA showed that the sampled bacteria from nodules are distributed throughout the five main 155 genospecies clades previously identified from isolates originating from these exact fields (Cavassim et 156 al., 2020) (Figure 2A-D). For the core genes rpoB and recA, the majority of the alleles identified by 157 7 actually present in the MAUI-seq dataset, but were under the cumulative abundance threshold that we 160 used. For the other three genes, MAUI-seq recovered more alleles than the isolates. 161

The accessory genes nodA and nodD belong to a group of co-located genes, known as the sym gene 162 cluster, that are essential for initiating and maintaining an effective symbiotic relationship with legumes. 163

The phylogeny of the accessory gene pool has previously been shown to often be incongruent with the 164 core genes (  management type, we then tested for the effect of country for the field trials or groupings for the DKO 204 samples. We observed no differentiation between the conventionally managed sites (DK+F+UK) and 205 the organic DKO population. The reason is that there is no overlap in Rhizobium populations between 206 the UK and DK+F trial sites. Therefore the difference between the three trial sites is as high as the 207 difference between trial sites and organic fields. To test the effect of groupings and field/plots on the 208 differentiation, we then analysed field trial sites (DK, F, and UK) and the organic fields (DKO) separately. 209

For the field trial subset, country (DK, F, and UK), had a significant effect ( Table 2). The block design 210 and clover genotype ( Figure S1) did not have any effect on FST with the exception of nodA, where there 211 was a small but highly significant effect. Permuting the plots within the individual field trial sites showed 212 that the plots are also significantly associated with Rhizobium population differentiation. Furthermore, 213 we added the block design and clover genotype level to the test ( Figure S1) and found that both block 214 and clover genotype had a small but significant effect on nodA differentiation when samples were 215 permuted within the same country ( Table 2). 216

In the DKO subset, the grouping (DKO1, DKO2, DKO3, DKO4, DKO5, DKO6), based on geographic 217 proximity (Figure 1), had a significant effect on differentiation for the core genes, recA and rpoB, but not for the accessory genes, nodA and nodD ( Table 2). Field had a significant effect for all four genes 219 within the DKO subset. We concluded that the grouping level was a valid way to cluster the samples for 220 the cores genes, and used the DKO subset to calculate pairwise FST between the six DKO clusters 221 (Figure 1 and Figure 4). The fields differ in geographic placement, while the clover genotypes and the 222 field management were similar between sites, allowing us to explore the geographic differences in 223 nodule population within a homogeneous set of managements (Table S1). 224

Pairwise FST between the DKO clusters displays a significant correlation between FST and geographic 225 distance. The overall FST is highest for the two core genes, and the correlation is highest and most 226 significant for rpoB (Figure 4). The level of genetic differentiation between populations increased with 227 distance, with the effect being most pronounced for chromosomal core genes, indicating that the core 228 gene population composition is related to geographic origin. Since the samples are not independent, 229

we performed a Mantel test with 5000 replicates to test if the correlation between FST and geographical 230 distance is significantly different from randomised datasets. Three genes, rpoB, recA, and nodA, have 231 a significant correlation between genetic differentiation and geographical distance (rpoB: R 2 =0.737, p-232 value=0.002, slope=6.310e-07; recA: R 2 =0.617, p-value=0.019, slope=4.156e-07; nodA: R 2 =0.632, p-233 value=0.047, slope=1.748e-07), but FST and geographical distance are not significantly correlated for 234 nodD (nodD: R 2 =0.420, p-value=0.115, slope=7.058e-08). 235 236 Limited allele correlation with soil chemical properties 237 Adaptations to ecological niches require different sets of genes. Genetic differentiation in soil microbial 238 communities is therefore often linked with the chemical and physical composition and pH of the soil. To 239 test whether the correlation between FST and geographical distance was due to geographically linked 240 differences in soil chemical composition, we tested the correlations between allele frequency and soil 241 traits from the fields where the samples were collected. 242

Several clusters of strong correlations between allele frequency and soil chemical and physical 243 properties were observed for the full dataset ( Figure S4A-D). The high clay content in the UK field trial 244 site and the unique set of gsB alleles observed in these samples drove this clustering (Table S1, Figure  245 2). Since none of the UK gsB alleles were observed in any other samples, no conclusions can be drawn 246 as to whether the gsB dominance is due to an increased fitness in clay, or to geographical influence. 247

To test a more homogeneous set of samples, we focused on the DKO subset, which had a broad range 248 of values for all soil chemical properties and no extreme values that could be confounded with rare 249 alleles. Two core gene alleles, rpoBseq2 (correlation with clay = 0.6141, p-value = 5.03e-05; silt: 250 correlation = 0.5877, p-value = 0.0001) and recAseq4, and one common nod allele (nodDseq2) were 251 highly correlated with silt and clay content, (Figure 4E and 4F, Figure S4). The recA allele was very 252 rare, and only occurred in four samples, whereof two had a high silt and clay content, driving the 253 correlation signal. rpoBseq2 and nodDseq2 were both correlated with silt and clay. Both alleles were 254 assigned to genospecies C ( Figure S2), and had a correlation of 0.525 (p-value = 0.0029). To 255 investigate whether these two alleles co-occur within the Rlt isolates, we BLASTed them against the 256 196 whole genome sequences. The rpoB allele was present in 36 of the genomes, whereas the nodD 257 allele was present in 55 genomes. The alleles co-occurred in 30 strains, most of which were isolated in 258 fields or field trials sites with a high clay/silt content, suggesting the genomic architecture of these strains 259 might confer some increased fitness in clay/silt rich soils. The majority of strong correlations observed 260 were between alleles, meaning some strains tend to co-occur, or between soil chemical properties that 261 are correlated (such as silt and clay) or mutually exclusive (such as coarse sand and fine sand). 262

Since no alleles or soil chemical properties are highly correlated with latitude or longitude, the FST 263 correlation with geographical distance (Figure 4) does not seem to be driven by differences in soil 264 chemistry or composition. At two of the trial sites (F and UK), only core genes from a single genospecies were detected, gsC and 273 gsB, respectively ( Figure 5A and B), though several alleles of the same genospecies were present 274 (Figures 2 and 5). The DK trial site had low levels of gsE, gsD, and gsB, while the dominant clade was 275 gsC. For the DKO samples, core genes belonging to all genospecies clades were found, and most 276 samples contained several genospecies at intermediate frequencies.

The raw UMI count was not higher for the DKO samples, indicating that the increase in observed genospecies is not due to sequencing 278 bias ( Figure S3). The diversity of core genes, rpoB and recA, for the F and UK trial sites matched the 279 genospecies distribution of isolates from these fields. For the DK site, low levels of core and accessory 280 gsB amplicons were found, although no gsB strains were isolated from here. The local gs distribution 281 matches the observations from our previous study of isolates from these sites (Cavassim et al., 2020), 282

indicating that the sampling of nodule isolates from fields can yield a good approximation of the actual 283 rhizobium population present in the nodules (Figure 5). 284

Overall, more genetic diversity was observed within the samples for the accessory genes than for core 285 genes for most sampling sites, predominantly due to the introgressing clade, X. Furthermore, most 286 samples from the three trial sites contained low levels of nod gene amplicons that were not assigned to 287 the core gene genospecies observed in the samples (Figure 5E  genospecies, but this introgression event was not captured by the isolates (Cavassim et al., 2020). 296

To investigate whether the microbial diversity was higher for DKO than for the field trial samples, we 297 calculated the nucleotide diversities (p). Comparing the nucleotide diversity of the individual DKO 298 groupings to the three separate field trial sites, most DKO groupings had a significantly higher than 299 the DK, F, and UK trial sites (Figure 6). Grouping the samples by field management revealed that 300 overall the organic DKO samples have significantly more diversity than the field trial samples for all four 301 amplicons (rpoB: p-value=3.007e-06, recA: p-value=8.601e-07, nodA: p-value=1.916e-09, nodD: p-302 value=2.875e-08) ( Figure S5). For our samples, this increase in nucleotide diversity within nodule 303 populations indicates that the microbial diversity of the Rhizobium population is higher in fields under 304 organic management than in field trial sites under conventional management. 305


Discussion


306

The increased focus on sustainable agricultural practices has increased the need for knowledge on the 307 impact of land management on biodiversity of all living things from mammals to fungi and bacteria. For 308 legume crops, a healthy soil microbiome, and especially the availability of nitrogen-fixing rhizobial 309 symbionts capable of establishing an effective symbiosis, plays an important role in establishing a high-310 yielding agricultural practice. 311

Most studies to assess field bacterial diversity have focused on Rhizobium isolates from Trifolium and 312 to investigate the reported level of diversity within the R. leguminosarum community found in white 316 clover nodules when using a HTAS approach compared to a more traditional isolate-based approach. 317

It has been estimated that 99% or more of environmental prokaryotes cannot be cultured using classical 318 methods in the laboratory. These obvious limitations are a challenge for many bacterial species, and 319 HTAS is commonly used to investigate communities without the need for cultivation (Costa et al., 2006). properties. Genetic differentiation for accessory genes is less correlated with distance than for core 345 genes, perhaps reflecting differences in local adaptation. It seems likely that nodD and nodA are not 346 adapted to local differences, but are adapted to the available symbiotic partner (here, white clover). The 347 movement of symbiosis genes may be less restricted since they are located on conjugative plasmids 348 (Cavassim et al., 2020). Mobility of accessory genes located on integrative conjugative elements (ICEs) 349 has previously been hypothesised to lead to lower genetic differentiation over distance than core genes 350 located on less mobile parts of the chromosome (Hoetzinger et al., 2017). In our case, the accessory 351 symbiosis genes, nodA and nodD, are located on conjugative plasmids shown to cross genospecies 352 boundaries, whereas there is little to no recombination between core genes (Cavassim et al., 2020). 353

Isolation-by-distance has been shown to be more pronounced for the core genome for aquatic 354 microbes, whereas the location of accessory genes on plasmids or on genomic islands renders them 355 more mobile and more dispersed in the environment (Hoetzinger et al., 2017), which might also be true 356 for bacterial populations in soil. In-depth analysis of allele frequencies in each sample is possible, due 357 to the number of nodules sampled when using amplicon sequencing. Using only the isolate dataset, we 358 would be limited to a few isolates per field/plot, and hence imprecise estimates of diversity. 359

Correlations between genetic differentiation and distance between populations are often confounded 360 by differences in soil physical and chemical properties. We tested the correlations between soil chemical 361 and physical properties, geospatial placement, and amplicon abundance. No significant correlations 362 were observed between latitude/longitude and soil properties. The observed positive correlation 363 between genetic differentiation and spatial separation is therefore unlikely to be due to soil chemical or 364 physical properties. The UK site, which had a uniform and unique composition of only gsB, has the highest phosphorus (P) content. P content has been shown to be correlated with rhizobium population 366 size in a previous study, but no genotyping was done (Wakelin et al., 2018). The high nutrient content 367 might enhance the fitness difference between fast-and slow-growing Rlt strains (Leff et al., 2015), 368 thereby driving the population differences between high and low P sites. 369

The level of nucleotide diversity ( ) observed within each nodule population sample was significantly 370 higher for samples from fields under organic management than from fields used for clover breeding 371 trials. This might reflect a lower diversity of Rlt in the soil at the clover breeding trial sites, possibly due 372 to an increase in nitrogen application (Zhao et al., 2019). The DK, F, and UK sites are very different in 373 soil composition, making it less likely that the lower Rlt genetic diversity is due to a soil-management 374 interaction than to a general effect of field management. The Rhizobium populations at the three sites 375 have distinct sets of alleles, suggesting that the management does not select for a specific set of Rlt, 376 but rather enriches already dominant or highly adapted strains, specific for each site. A more diverse 377 collection of clover genotypes was grown at the DK, F, and UK sites than for DKO fields, so the reduction 378 in diversity is unlikely to be an effect of clover genotype selection. The varied genospecies distribution 379 of isolates from the DKO fields hinted at a higher diversity in these fields compared to the field trial sites, 380 but the differences in sampling distance between DKO isolates (up to 200km) and isolates from 381 individual field trials (<200m) impeded a detailed investigation. For the amplicon-based study, we 382 collected 100 nodules from each field, which allowed us to treat each field as an individual data point in 383 the diversity analysis. This revealed the striking differences in nucleotide diversity between fields under 384 different management regimes. 385

A study of spatial variation of Rhizobium symbiotic performance used a field sampling layout to test the 386 effect at different spatial scales (Wakelin et al., 2018). Similar study designs, with neighbouring fields 387 managed in different ways, would be appropriate for a more in-depth assessment of the effect of 388 management on Rhizobium populations while disentangling it from geographical and soil chemical 389 variation. Our results, in combination with previous studies, provide an indication that there could be 390 substantial effects of field management on Rhizobium diversity and should motivate further studies on 391 the effect of field management on soil microbial diversity at the level of individual species. We show that 392 HTAS in the form of MAUI-seq on pooled nodules is an efficient method for estimating Rhizobium 393 diversity in nodules, and a previous study has shown that the method can also be applied to soil samples 394 (Boivin et al., 2020). There was good agreement between the alleles detected by amplicon sequencing and those found in isolates cultured from nodules at the same sites, and MAUI-seq can provide more 396 detailed estimates of allele frequencies without the need to culture and characterise large numbers of 397 individual isolates. 398

Nodule sample collection 400

White clover (Trifolium repens) root nodules were sampled from three clover field trials under identical 401 management in Denmark (Store Heddinge, DK), France (Rennes, F), and the United Kingdom 402 (Didbrook, UK). At each site, 18 F2 families (1-18) and two commercial varieties (K and C) were grown 403 in duplicate in a similar block setup (Table S1 and Figure S1). In addition, 50 samples were collected 404 from Danish clover fields under organic management. The clover varieties grown at each field can be 405 seen in Table S1. A total of 170 samples was collected (Figure 1, Table S1, 


Read processing and data analysis 430

Paired-end reads were merged using the PEAR assembler (Zhang et al., 2014). Reads were separated 431 by gene, filtered using the MAUI-seq method using a secondary/primary read ratio of 0.7 and a filter of 432 0.1% UMI abundance was added as previously described (Fields et al., 2019). 433

Neighbour-joining phylogenetic trees were constructed using MEGAX software with 500 bootstrap 434 repetitions. Rlt reference sequences for all four genes were extracted from the 196 strains with available 435 whole genome sequencing data (Cavassim et al., 2020). Relative allele abundance was calculated for 436 both the MAUI-seq data and the 196 Rlt genomes. Raw UMI counts are shown in Figure S3. and clover genotype data is available in Table S1.  Levels of sampling are: country level (Figure 1, DK, F, and UK), grouping level (Figure 1, DKO1, 613 DKO2, DKO3, DKO4, DKO5, DKO6), and field/plot level (individual samples from fields within 614 groupings and plots within field trials, Figure 1 and Figure S1). Block level and clover genotype level 615 ( Figure S1) are also included for the field trial subset. Numbers show the FST estimates of each level 616 out of the total variance (e.g. Fcountry/total) and within outer levels (e.g. effect of block level within each 617 country: Fblock/country). Statistically significant values compared to 1000 random permutations are 618 indicated with asterisks: *p<0.05, **p<0.01, and ***p<0.001. 619      


of plants and microorganisms in the soil has a multitude of beneficial functions in natural 41 ecosystems, including protection against pathogens (Berendsen et al., 2012; Schlatter et al., 2017) and 42 abiotic stress such as drought, uptake of nutrients like phosphate and nitrogen(Oldroyd et al., 2011; 43 Gutjahr & Parniske, 2013), and growth promotion (Panke-Buisse et al., 2015). 44

50Mora et al., 2008; Vos & Velicer, 2008; Hahn et al., 2015). 51 Biological nitrogen fixation (BN)F occurs as a result of a mutualistic symbiosis between legumes and 52 soil bacteria, commonly known as rhizobia. Rhizobia are harboured in specialised root structures, 53 known as nodules. To confidently establish the level of diversity within nodule populations, the most 54 common assessment method uses cultured bacteria isolated from nodules (Sbabou et al., 2016; Efrose 55 et al., 2018; Stefan et al., 2018; Boivin et al., 2020; Cavassim et al., 2020). Isolate-based approaches 56 different management, samples from organic fields had significantly higher genetic diversity than fields 130 used for conventional clover breeding trials, indicating that biodiversity of clover symbionts characterised 196 Rlt genomes isolated from pink nodules collected from 40 plots in 135 three clover breeding trial sites at Rennes in France (F), Didbrook in England (UK), and Store Heddinge 136 in Denmark (DK), as well as from 50 fields on Danish organic farms (DKO) (Figure 1). The strains were 137 distributed throughout five of the seven known genospecies for Rl, with some genospecies being highly 138 site-specific. gsC was the dominant genospecies at all sites except the UK trial site, where only gsB 139 was present. Conversely, gsB was only found at the UK site. 140 To investigate whether this set of 196 genomes is representative of the Rlt diversity at the sampled 141 sites we collected nodules from the plots within the trials sites and the organic fields, leaving us with a 142 total of 170 samples of nitrogen-fixing white clover root nodules from European field sites (Figure 1, 143 Figure S1). Using the MAUI-seq method (Fields et al., 2019), 100 pooled nodules per sample yielded 144 genotype frequencies of two core (rpoB and recA) and two accessory (nodA and nodD) genes in 170 145 samples. After filtering for samples with missing data or low UMI count, 105 rpoB samples, 153 recA 146 samples, 129 nodA samples, and 130 nodD samples were used for downstream analysis. 147 148 Geographically distinct sites display a site-specific set of nodule Rhizobium alleles 149 Rhizobium leguminosarum is a species complex consisting of multiple genospecies that have been 150 shown to co-exist in a field setting (Kumar et al., 2015; Boivin et al., 2020; Cavassim et al., 2020). Rlt 151 core genes show little sign of introgression between genospecies, and phylogenies of individual core 152 genes therefore most often follow the overall genospecies phylogenetic tree (Stefan et al., 2018; 153 Cavassim et al., 2020). A phylogenetic analysis of amplicons from the chromosomal core genes rpoB 154


Tian et al., 2010; van Cauwenberghe et al., 2014; Andrews et al., 2018; Efrose et al., 2018; 165 Cavassim et al., 2020). This cluster is usually located on a conjugative plasmid in the Rl species 166 complex (Kumar et al., 2015; Boivin et al., 2020; Cavassim et al., 2020). Occasionally, regions of the 167 cluster are duplicated in the rhizobial genome and, due to the promiscuous nature of conjugative 168 plasmids, they can cross genospecies boundaries (Cavassim et al., 2020). Using the set of 196 169 characterised Rlt isolates from the same sampling sites, we evaluated the level of duplication of nod 170 genes to remove potential paralogs. In addition to the full nod gene region (nodXNMLEFDABCIJ), a 171 partial set of nod genes (nodDABCIJT) is present in some of the Rlt isolates. nodAseq7 and nodDseq9 172 occurred only as secondary sequences in this partial nod region and were designated as nodAa and 173 nodDa, respectively (Figure 2C-D). A third type of nodD (nodD2) was observed in some genomes 174 flanked by transposases and no other nod genes (Kelly et al., 2018; Ferguson et al., 2020). Three nodD 175 amplicons belong to this group. These five paralogous sequences were removed from all downstream 176 analysis to avoid inflating the estimates of overall diversity. All 12 nodD alleles seen in the genomes 177 were recovered by MAUI-seq, plus an additional 5 alleles. MAUI-seq detected 12 of the 14 nodA alleles 178 seen in genomes, but found an additional 9 alleles (Table 1 and Figure 1). All of the abundant 179 sequences with frequency > 0.15 have an exact match in the 196 Rlt genomes, and the allele 180frequencies are highly correlated between the two datasets (Figure 2E-H). The sequences identified 181 only by MAUI-seq are of low abundance, but appear to be genuine sequences(Figure 2A-D andFigure 182


3). Likewise, the sequences in the 196 genomes not found by MAUI-seq are only present in a small 183 number of isolates and at low frequencies; 8 out of the 13 sequences are only found in a single isolate 184 (Figure 2). 185 Principal component analysis of the amplicons from individual genes (Figure S2), revealed that different 186 loci have different levels of resolution. recA separated the French samples well from all other locations, 187 whereas the UK samples were clearly separated from the other two field trial sites for all four loci. The 188 high level of diversity among and within DKO samples made it difficult to distinguish them from the F 189 and DK samples for most amplicons. 190 Each breeding trial site (DK, F, and UK) showed a distinct set of amplicons, despite the nodules from 191 each site being sampled from the same F2 clover families from the same seedstock and being under 192 identical management (Table S1, Figure 3). The samples from the trial sites were relatively uniform 193 within each site, and each sample had a low number of total observed amplicons, whereas the DKO 194 samples appeared less homogeneous within each sample. 195 196 Genetic differentiation is correlated with spatial separation 197 To assess the biogeographic patterns of nodule populations, we calculated the hierarchical FST of 198 samples at different population levels. The top level was management, where we compared organic 199 fields (DKO) versus field trial sites, whereas plot and field were the lowest levels for the field trials and 200 DKO samples, respectively (Figure 1 and Figure S1). Significance was tested by permutation. For 201 example, when comparing organic (DKO) versus conventional (field trial) management, samples were 202 moved from one management to the other to check if this generally resulted in a lower FST. For each 203

265 266
265Bacterial richness within samples is higher for fields under organic management 267To assess the effect of field management on Rhizobium diversity, we analysed the genospecies 268 composition of each individual sample. The amplicons from all four genes were assigned to 269 genospecies A-E (Figure S2) (Kumar et al., 2015). nodA and nodD amplicons were assigned as X if 270 they were within an introgressing clade of plasmid-borne sym genes(Figure S2C-D)(Cavassim et al.,  271   2020). The genospecies composition was plotted for each individual sample of 100 nodules(Figure 5). 272


and G). Most of these belong to the 288 introgressing clade, X, which is consistent with previous observations on large Rlt populations 289 (Cavassim et al., 2020). 290 Some nod gene amplicons do not match the core gene composition. The French samples are 291 exclusively gsC for the core genes, rpoB and recA, whereas the UK samples are exclusively gsB 292 (Figure 5A and 5C). The accessory genes, nodA and nodD, include sequences designated as gsE and 293 gsC for the French and UK samples, respectively,(Figure 5E and 5G), based on the genospecies 294 designation from the 196 Rlt isolates. This indicates that these sym gene alleles introgress between 295


Vicia nodules (Sbabou et al., 2016; Efrose et al., 2018; Stefan et al., 2018; Cavassim et al., 2020). Here, 313 we present an in-depth study of clover field trials and organic fields where strains have previously been 314 isolated (Cavassim et al., 2020), using the MAUI-seq method (Fields et al., 2019) on nodule populations 315


320R. leguminosarum is easily cultured from nodules in the laboratory, but it is slow growing and requires 321 several rounds of single colony isolation before it can be separated from faster growing bacteria present 322 in and around the nodule. Studying large numbers of nodules therefore requires both time and 323 resources. HTAS offers the advantage that it allows for screening a large number of samples with many 324 organisms per sample in a fast and efficient manner. We have adapted this method using MAUI-seq to 325 study the intraspecies diversity of R. leguminosarum in nodules, to allow screening of large nodule326 populations from many sampling sites. While amplicon studies are ideal for sampling large numbers of 327 samples (here, nodules), good quality sequences of the organism of choice are necessary to design 328 specific, yet effective primers for any non-standard amplicon. The 196 sequenced Rlt isolates have 329 formed the basis of the phylogenetic analysis and thereby the introgression analysis of this study. Here, 330 we use amplicon sequencing to check that the isolates are representative of the nodule population as 331 a whole. 332 There was good agreement between the two methods in estimating the allele frequency and 333 genospecies composition of the nodule populations, though more rare alleles were observed in the seq compared to the isolate-based study. Many amplicon-based studies have assessed enrichment of 336 many bacterial species in the rhizosphere or other soil compartments compared to bulk soil or between 337 managements (Baudoin et al., 2003; Costa et al., 2006; Schreiter et al., 2014; Coller et al., 2019). 338 Similarly, a modified version of MAUI-seq has been used to investigate the Rhizobium population in soil 339 and how it differs from nodule populations from Vicia and Trifolium host plants of Rhizobium (Boivin et 340 al., 2020). Cultivating slow-growing bacteria from soil can be very difficult, and amplicon sequencing 341 enables studies of populations in bulk soil that would otherwise have been unfeasible. 342 Using the broadly sampled set of nodule amplicons allowed us to make comparisons between nodule 343 populations in soils under different managements and with different soil chemical and physical 344


400g) was collected from a representative spot in each DKO field. For clover field trials 6 411 representative samples of 400g soil were collected in the clover-free aisles between the plots. Each plot 412 was then assigned the values of the nearest soil sampling site. Soil chemical analysis was performed 413 by AGROLAB Agrar und Umwelt GmbH (Germany). Traits measured were: pH, phosphorus (mg/100g), 414 potassium (mg/100g), magnesium (mg/100g), copper (mg/kg), humus, coarse sand (0.2-2mm), fine 415 sand (0.02-0.2mm), silt (0.002-0.02mm), and clay (<0.002mm). 416 417 DNA extraction, library preparation, and sequencing 418 Nodule samples were thawed at ambient temperature and crushed using a sterile homogeniser stick. 419 DNA was extracted from the homogenised nodule samples using the DNeasy PowerLyzer PowerSoil 420 DNA isolation kit (QIAGEN, USA). DNA was amplified for two core genes (rpoB and recA) and two 421 accessory genes (nodA and nodD). Amplification, library preparation, and sequencing was done using 422 the MAUI-seq method (Fields et al., 2019). Sequencing was done on a Illumina MiSeq (2x300bp paired 423 end reads) by the University of York Technology Facility. 424 The amplification and library preparation reported in this study were done at an early stage of method 425 development, leading to some missing data (Figure 2, nSamples_rpoB: 105, nSamples_recA: 153, 426 nSamples_nodA: 129, nSamples_nodD: 130). The method has been improved since then and now has 427 429


437Geographical maps were generated using the R packages 'maps' and 'ggplot2' (R Core team, 2015; 438Wickham, 2016). Heatmaps were generated from relative allele abundance of individual genes using 439 'ggplot2'. The hierarchical F-statistics (FST) were calculated using the 'varcomp.glob' function and tested 440 using 'test.between' and 'test.within' in the 'Hierfstat' R package (Goudet & Jombart, 2015). Correlations 441 and associated p-values were calculated using the 'agricolae' R package (de Mendiburu, 2014). 442 Pairwise geographic distances were calculated using the 'geosphere' R package (Hijmans et al., 2019). 443 Mantel tests were performed using 5000 repetitions in the 'ade4' R package (Dray & Dufour, 2007). 444 Correlations between soil chemical properties and allele frequency were done using base R and 445 visualised using 'corrplot' (Wei & Simko, 2016). 446 Nucleotide diversity (p, the average number of nucleotide differences per site between two DNA 447 sequences in all possible pairs in the sample population) was calculated for each individual sample 448 within the DKO and field trial data using a custom script. 449 450 Acknowledgements 451 We thank David Sherlock for his help with developing the method, the University of York Technology 452 Facility for sequencing, Asger Bachmann and Terry Mun for preliminary data analysis and script 453 development, SEGES and the farmers for access to the organic fields, and DLF for access to their 454 clover field trials.
