Copper (Cu) is a widely used catalyst for the nitrate reduction reaction (NO 3 RR), but its susceptibility to surface oxidation and complex electrochemical conditions hinders the identification of active sites.Here, we employed electropolished metallic Cu with a predominant (100) surface and compared it to native oxide-covered Cu.The electropolished Cu surface rapidly oxidized after exposure to either air or electrolyte solutions.However, this oxide was reduced below 0.1 V vs. RHE, thus returning to the metallic Cu before NO 3 RR.It was distinguished from the native oxide on Cu, which remained during NO 3 RR.Fast NO 3 − and NO reduction on the metallic Cu delivered 91.5 ± 3.7% faradaic efficiency for NH 3 at −0.4 V vs. RHE.In contrast, the native oxide on Cu formed undesired products and low NH 3 yield.Operando shell-isolated nanoparticle-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SHINERS) analysis revealed the adsorbed NO 3 − , NO 2 , and NO species on the electropolished Cu as the intermediates of NH 3 .Low overpotential NO 3 − and NO adsorptions and favorable NO reduction are key to increased NH 3 productivity over Cu samples, which was consistent with the DFT calculation on Cu(100).−5][6]There is growing interest in using reactive nitrogen pollutants as an NH 3 source to address environmental concerns and explore clean energy alternatives.Electrochemical NO 3[18]NO 39][20]Two key steps determine activity and selectivity; (i) the initial NO 3 − reduction to nitrite (*NO 2 ) is the rate-determining step.The sluggish process caused signicant onset overpotential.21,22(ii)The *NO binding strength on the catalyst signicantly impacts selective NH 3 production.][23][24]Various catalysts have been investigated to optimize *NO 3 − and *NO adsorption.Copper (Cu) emerges as the most economical choice in addition to its ability to create a signicant potential gap between NO 3 − reduction and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER).Both Cu(111) 25-28 and (100) facets 9,29 exhibited reasonable activity in overall processes, and their performance was further enhanced when forming alloys or

Introduction

1][32][33][34] However, the vulnerable nature of the Cu surface has posed challenges in identifying the actual active sites and their roles; the metallic Cu undergoes quick oxidation in the air or an electrolyte solution.Conversely, the Cu oxides are electrochemically reduced.However, degrees of oxidation and reduction vary depending on the conditions and have not been easily controlled.For instance, CuO nanostructures transformed into Cu/Cu 2 O heterostructures through in situ reduction. 12Although the heterostructure showed better NH 3 productivity, identifying the true active sites has proven difficult due to the presence of defect/ strain structures with varying surface roughnesses 9,[35][36][37] and the complexity of valence states at Cu/Cu 2 O sites. 38ere, we focused on the Cu surface states that are essential as the active sites to determine NO 3 RR activity and selectivity.Three surface states of Cu foil were prepared, representing the native oxide-covered Cu, partially etched native oxide, and metallic Cu surface with a predominant (100) facet.It was found that the metallic Cu surface was oxidized by air or electrolyte solution.However, this oxide layer was rapidly eliminated below 0.1 V vs. RHE (before starting NO 3 RR).The reverted metallic Cu surface facilitated NO 3 − and NO reductions and offered 91.5 ± 3.7% of


Results and discussion

We prepared three types of Cu foils using different surface treatments (Scheme S1 and Experimental details in ESI †).First, as-received Cu foil was washed with acetone, isopropanol, and de-ionized (DI) water sequentially using bath sonication for 5 min each.The resulting Cu foil was named w-Cu.The second and third methods eliminated the native oxide layer of w-Cu. 39,40he w-Cu was soaked in glacial acetic acid for 5 min, 41 which was indicated as a-Cu.Separately, w-Cu was electrochemically polished by applying 2 V for 5 min in 85 wt% H 3 PO 4 solution, 42,43 denoted as e-Cu.All these treatments were conducted just before surface characterizations or NO 3 RR tests.

The as-received Cu surface state and morphology remained intact in w-Cu (Fig. 1a).Scanning electron microscope (SEM) and atomic force microscope (AFM) displayed stripe patterns on the Cu surface, attributed to root-mean-square (RMS) roughness at 14.4 nm in 100 mm 2 area.While a-Cu had a similar surface pattern, a surface RMS increased to 25.4 nm (Fig. 1b).It indicated non-uniform and incomplete surface etching.Electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) analysis revealed a prevalent Cu(100) facet (red) over both w-Cu and a-Cu surfaces, while various polycrystals also appeared with small domains.Chemical analyses using Auger spectra (Fig. 1) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Fig. S1 †) showed intense Cu + and Cu 2+ signals for both samples, i.e., the presence of Cu 2 O and CuO.Quantitatively, the surface of w-Cu was covered by 81% Cu + and 21% Cu 2+ (Fig. S2 †).There were no metallic Cu 0 present in the Cu Auger spectra.In comparison, a-Cu had a partially metallic Cu surface (37%) due to etching, although the major species was Cu + (63%).Native Cu oxide on w-Cu was further analysed using cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy (TEM), exhibiting CuO(111) and (002) with 0.23 and 0.25 nm d-spacings, respectively (Fig. 2a).The thicknesses were varied from 2 to 40 nm in multiple areas (Fig. 2b).

In contrast, e-Cu had a stripe-free and even surface with Cu(100) facet (RMS: 1.9 nm, Fig. 1c).Auger and XPS analyses identied the prevalent metallic Cu 0 (71% coverage) on the surface, demonstrating the complete elimination of the oxide layer (Fig. S1 and S2 †).

Three types of Cu foils were susceptible to oxidation when electrochemical cells were assembled in ambient air and stabilized in an electrolyte solution.Thus, the actual surface states before NO 3 RR tests should be identied.We analysed Cu surfaces aer air-tight H-cell installation (details in Fig. S3 †) and argon (Ar) gas purge into 1 M KOH solution for 10 min.Auger spectra revealed a growing Cu + signal on e-Cu and a-Cu compared to a negligible change on w-Cu (Fig. 2c), indicating immediate oxidation arising from the metallic Cu sites.We also note that residual organic contaminants appearing on w-Cu were removed by soaking in the KOH solution (Fig. S1 and S4 †).

However, the instantly oxidized Cu differs from the native oxide; the former was rapidly removed before or during the initial NO 3 RR tests.We tracked different reduction potentials of these oxide layers in 1 M KOH solution.Cathodic linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) in Fig. 2d shows three potential regions: (i) 0.4-0.5 V (vs.RHE unless otherwise stated), (ii) 0.1-0.4V, and (iii) −0.25-−0.45V.6][47] The cathodic signal of CuO was developed in (i) for all samples.However, the Cu(OH) 2 /Cu 2 O reduction in the (ii) region was applied for e-Cu only.9][50] The appearance of the cathodic peaks in (iii) is, therefore, likely due to the thick native oxide (up to 40 nm). 45,46,48,49,51During the second LSV scan, all oxide/hydroxide signals vanished (Fig. 2e).It indicates that the metallic Cu surface was recovered on e-Cu below 0.1 V, whereas the native oxide was reduced to below −0.4 V.

Next, NO 3 RRs were examined with 50 mM KNO 3 .Cathodic LSVs showed two waves for e-Cu and three for a-Cu and w-Cu (Fig. 3a-c).The initial (c 1 ) and second waves (c 2 ) appeared for all Cu foils, while the third one (c 3 ) at higher overpotentials only emerged for a-Cu and w-Cu (Fig. 3a-c).To identify each signal, NO 2 − or NO, which are key intermediates in NO 3 RR, was added to a 1 M KOH solution without NO 3 − . 29Adding 50 mM NaNO 2 vanished the c 1 wave, identifying c 1 to the NO 3 − reduction to NO 2 /NO 2 − .NO gas was generated by Cu powder and neat nitric acid (HNO 3 ) reaction and introduced to the electrochemical cell through the Ar stream (Scheme S2 †). 52Emerging NO cathodic waves notably relied on the Cu surfaces; the metallic Cu on e-Cu promoted the NO reduction at c 2 (−0.02V) with a signicant current density (J), whereas the native Cu oxide of w-Cu reduced NO at c 3 (−0.31V).The a-Cu allowed both c 2 (−0.10 V) and c 3 (−0.28V) due to the coexistence of both metallic Cu and Cu oxide. 21Consequently, metallic Cu offered more active sites for prompt NO reduction and caused the absence of c 3 .

For the potential aspect, e-Cu offered more positive (i.e., lower overpotentials) for c 1 (>100 mV) and c 2 (>50 mV) compared to those for a-Cu and w-Cu (Table 1).The rate-determining NO 3

− reduction to NO 2 − was signicantly catalysed by the metallic Cu and improved overall reaction kinetics.][55][56][57] Furthermore, the active sites on e-Cu were stable.Cyclic voltammograms (CVs) exhibited constant NO-reducing waves during three cycles, although sample surfaces were roughened during NO 3 RR (Fig. S6 and S7 †).To depict electrochemical active surface area (ECSA), we estimated the roughness factors from two methods: the RMS surface roughness from the AFM measurement and the electric double layer capacitance (EDLC) relative to the specic capacitance, as shown in Table S2 and  S3.† Both methods consistently resulted in the lowest roughness factor and ECSA for the as-prepared e-Cu.During NO 3 RR, the EDLC of e-Cu increased more than a-Cu and w-Cu (Fig. S8a †).However, the geometric-area-normalized current densities were constant during CV cycling (Fig. S6 †).In addition, e-Cu still exhibited the highest ECSA-normalized current density in the fourth cycled CV (Fig. S8 and Table S3 †).It corroborated the stable and preserved active sites on e-Cu regardless of the increased surface roughness.

The selectivity and yield of NH 3 production was assessed by chronoamperometry (CA) tests and colorimetric analyses of the electrolyte solution (NO 2 − and NH 3 detection, Fig. S9-S11 †). 12,18,21For e-Cu, faradaic efficiency of NH 3 (FE NH 3 ) was 41.6% at 0.0 V and maximized to 91.5% at −0.4 V during 1 h reaction (Fig. 3d).Isotope labeling tests demonstrated that NO 3 − was the exclusive N source to form NH 3 (Fig. S12 †).

Declining FE NH 3 below −0.4 V was attributed to HER included in the increased undetected species.By comparison, w-Cu and a-Cu generated <1% FE NH 3 at 0.0 V, where NO 2 − was the primary product (Fig. 3e and f).A very small current density hindered a precise quantication (>100% FE), and this result is explained by an insignicant current density at c 1 in the LSV (Fig. 2b and c).High charge-transfer resistances obtained at 0.0 V and −0.1 V also illustrated sluggish NO 3 − reduction on the native Cu oxide (Fig. S13 †).At −0.4 V, although FE NH 3 was developed to 84.8% (a-Cu) and 56.9% (w-Cu), the efficiency was still inferior to e-Cu.We also found that the undetected species became the maximum at −0.3 V from w-Cu and decreased toward the negative potential, distinct from the e-Cu trend (Fig. 3f).Undesired products, such as N 2 O, NH 2 OH, and N 2 , were produced from w-Cu (Fig. S14 †) due to weak *NO adsorption on the native oxide. 58,59A subsequent decline of undetected species indicated a slow HER from the oxide layer that was not wholly eliminated during NO 3 RR.The a-Cu showed an in-between tendency as existing both Cu 0 and native oxide (Fig. 3e).Still, the contribution of metallic Cu for FE NH 3 was notable at −0.2-−0.4V.As a result, e-Cu showed an excellent NH 3 yield rate and half-cell energy efficiency (Table 1 and Fig. S15 †), verifying the best NH 3 selectivity.

To further shed light on the NO 3 RR process, e-Cu and w-Cu surfaces were observed by operando electrochemical shellisolated nanoparticle-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SHINERS) using Au@SiO 2 nanoparticles and Naon binder (Fig. 4a, S16 and S17, and details in ESI †).Spectra of asprepared e-Cu and w-Cu surfaces showed peaks of Cu 2 O (430 cm −1 ), Cu(OH) x (489 cm −1 ), and CuO (630 cm −1 ) (the le panel of Fig. 4b, c and Table S4 †).However, the oxide/hydroxide peaks from e-Cu weakened at 0.0-−0.2V, validating a recovery of the metallic Cu surface during NO 3 RR (Fig. S18 †).The trend is more evident when comparing peak-height intensity with potential change, as shown in Fig. S18.† During NO 3 RR, e-Cu showed that the peaks of Cu(OH) x and CuO were almost completely absent, while Cu 2 O species exhibited a relatively small decrease.In sharp contrast, w-Cu preserved all oxide peaks in 0.0-−0.5 V.At the end of NO 3 RR, the peaks of Cu oxides remained on w-Cu but not on e-Cu.

NO 3 RR intermediates were observed in 900-1700 cm −1 region (the right panel of Fig. 4b, c and Table S5 †), where peaks of Naon binder and residual citrate used for the synthesis of Au nanoparticles (Fig. S19 †) also appeared, marked as C and B, respectively.Before applying a potential, a strong symmetric stretching peak of NO 3 − (n s (NO 3


−

), 1047 cm −1 ) in the solution emerged.At 0.0 V, this intensity weakened on e-Cu, while asymmetric NO 2 of NO 3 − peak (n as (NO 2 ), 1354 cm −1 ) 60,61 was intensied, possibly due to *NO 3 − adsorption (the right panel of

in this potential range, suggesting that the accessible NO is weakly absorbed on w-Cu or reacts undesirably with redissolved NO, which was supported by the increased undetected species in Fig. 3f.The apparent *NO peak was observed at −0.3 V, which aligned with the NO reduction potential (c 3 ) in the LSV (Fig. 3c) and the increased FE NH 3 below −0.3 V (Fig. 3f).DFT calculations also supported the notable inuence of the Cu valence state on *NO 2 and *NO reductions using three Cu surface models: Cu(100), Cu 2 O(100), and CuO(100) (Fig. S20 and Computational details in ESI †).We rst examined the formation of *NO from the reduction of *NO 2 and calculated Gibbs free energy changes (DG) on different Cu surfaces at pH = 14 (Tables S6-S8 †).The DG value is positive on all Cu surfaces, implying a thermodynamically energy-consuming reduction process.However, each surface has only a small difference in DG, around 0.75 eV.

Subsequent reduction of *NO through the DG was calculated.][67] Fig. 4d-f   positive values (>1.8 eV) due to the thermodynamic barrier toward *N, which was suggested to be a highly NH 3 -selective intermediate. 65The DG for the formation of H*NO and *NOH are also calculated through *NO reduction.Cu 2 O(100) and CuO(100) surfaces showed the lowest DG for H*NO compared to *N and *NOH, consistent with the appearance of H*NO species in the Raman spectrum at −0.1-−0.2V (Fig. 4c).Nonetheless, the energy barrier for H*NO and *NOH formation with *NO reduction was lower at the Cu(100) surface than at Cu oxides.It suggests that all intermediates from the *NO reduction can be produced more easily on the metallic Cu surface, consistent with the available experimental results.


Conclusions

In summary, we studied Cu surface states for NO 3 RR activity and selectivity.The native oxide layer on Cu involved slow NO 3 − and NO reduction and produced undesired products.In contrast, metallic Cu with an even surface produced NH 3 with better activity and selectivity.Although the metallic Cu was immediately oxidized in air or electrolyte solution, this oxide was rapidly reduced below 0.1 V. Therefore, the metallic Cu 0 surface was recovered in contrast to the persistent native oxide.Electrochemical tests, operando Raman spectroscopy, and DFT calculations consistently demonstrated the metallic Cu as the active sites of NO 3 RR, attributed to suitable *NO 3 − and *NO adsorptions and following their rapid reductions.

faradaic efficiency at −0.4 V vs. RHE.In contrast, native oxide on Cu was not fully removed under the same electrochemical condition, providing inferior NH 3 productivity.Operando Raman spectroscopy analysis revealed *NO *NO 2 , and *NO species on metallic Cu as the intermediates of NH 3 .Subsequent reductions of *NO 3 − and *NO are associated with NH 3 productivity, which is further supported by the DFT calculation.In contrast, the native oxide on Cu did not clearly show these intermediates and appeared *NO with higher overpotential.
