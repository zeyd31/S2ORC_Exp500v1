N-acetyl pyrazoline derivatives A-C containing methoxy and chloro/hydroxyl substituents were synthesized and tested for their cytotoxic activities.The precursor chalcones A-C which were obtained from the condensation reaction between veratraldehyde and acetophenone derivatives were reacted with hydrazine hydrate in the presence of glacial acetic acid to give pyrazolines A-C with excellent yield and purity.Characterization of all products was done using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometers.(GC-MS).Cytotoxicity evaluation of pyrazolines revealed that pyrazoline A has moderate activity against breast cancer cell line MCF7 (IC 50 40.47µg/ml), breast cancer cell line T47D (IC 50 26.51µg/ml), and cervical cancer cell line HeLa (IC 50 31.19µg/ml).Pyrazoline B is inactive against all tested cancer lines (IC 50 > 100 µg/ml).Pyrazoline C has moderate activity against MCF7 (IC 50 94.02µg/ml), but inactive against T47D and HeLa.Docking study showed the interaction between pyrazolines and EGFR receptor via hydrogen bonds and π-cation interactions.

INTRODUCTION

Cancer is a group of diseases defined by the rapid, uncontrolled, and pathological proliferation of the abnormal cells (Karabacak et al., 2015).Globally, following cardiovascular disorders, cancer is the second-leading disease that causes death (Patel et al., 2011).In 2013, the two types of cancer with the most cases which occurred in Indonesia were cervical and breast cancer with 98,692 cases and 61,682 cases, respectively (Kementerian Kesehatan, 2015).Resistance, lack of selectivity, and the occurrence of side effect to chemotherapeutic agents remain challenging problems in the medical field.Therefore, novel anticancer agents must be developed to suppress this issue.

Pyrazolines, a class of electron-rich nitrogen heterocyclic compounds, have versatile uses in the medicinal chemistry.They possess a wide range of pharmacological functions such as anticancer, antitubercular, antimalarial, antibacterial, antifungal, anti-inflammatory, analgesic, anticonvulsant, and antioxidant activities (Ahmad et al., 2016;Beyhan et al., 2017;Karad et al., 2016;Kumar et al., 2013;Lv et al., 2010;Rani et al., 2012;Viveka et al., 2015).

Molecular docking studies of pyrazoline derivatives against two types of epidermal growth factor receptor kinase, which are epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2) were reported (Mubeen et al., 2015;Yang et al., 2013).In many cases, those proteins are often overexpressed in breast and cervical cancer (Masuda et al., 2012;Tian et al., 2016).The molecular docking studies revealed the important factors influencing their activity as anticancer agents that were in the N-N bond of the pyrazoline ring and the various functional groups attached to the benzene rings (Yang et al., 2013).Pyrazoline derivatives containing an acetyl group attached to the nitrogen atom, called N-acetyl pyrazolines, are reported to produce excellent cytotoxic activity.Moreover, the presence of a methoxy substituent on the benzene B-ring enhanced its activities together with the presence of chloro and hydroxyl substituent on the para position of the benzene A-ring (Sharma et al., 2014).

A well-known method to synthesize pyrazolines is through a cyclocondensation reaction between hydrazines with α,β-unsaturated aldehydes or ketones.In this method, intermediate hydrazones are formed that undergo cyclization in the presence of a cyclizing reagent such as acetic acid to yield pyrazolines (Shaaban et al., 2012).

In the light of the above findings, we aimed to synthesize N-acetyl pyrazoline derivatives bearing methoxy, chloro, and hydroxyl substituents (Fig. 1).Their cytotoxicity was evaluated against breast cancer cell lines (MCF7 and T47D) and the cervical cancer cell line (HeLa) using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) method.

The cytotoxic activity assay

All cell lines were cultured in 5% CO 2 water-saturated atmosphere at 37°C with medium DMEM/10% FBS for cancer cell line (MCF7, T47D, and HeLa) and M199/10% FBS for normal cell line (Vero).Cell suspensions (10 6 /ml) were prepared, and 100 µl/well were dispensed into a 96-well plate giving 10 4 cells/well.The plates were incubated for 24 hours to allow the cells to reattach.Pyrazolines were initially formulated at 10 5 µg/ ml in DMSO.These samples were diluted with a culture medium to give six serial concentration: 200, 100, 50, 25, 12.5, and 6.25 µg/ml.Aliquots (100 µl) of each concentration were added to the wells.After further incubation for 24 hours, the cell viability was evaluated using the MTT assay.The culture medium on plates was removed and washed with PBS.A solution of MTT in PBS was prepared at 50 mg/10 ml.Aliquots (1 ml) of MTT solution were diluted with 9.5-ml culture medium.Aliquots (100 µl) of diluted MTT were added to the wells and incubated for 4 hours.A total of 100 µl SDS stopper 10% in 0.1 N HCl was added into each well and left overnight.Absorbance readings were performed by ELISA reader at 595 nm.Cell viability and IC 50 value were calculated.


Docking study

The three-dimensional (3D) structure of pyrazolines A-C was drawn using GaussView 5.0 and optimized using Gaussian 09 with DFT/B3LYP method and 6-31G basis set.The 3D crystal structure of the EGFR domain bound to Erlotinib was retrieved from the protein data bank (PDB ID: 1M17).The preparation of ligand and protein was conducted using Chimera.Redocking and docking were performed with Autodock Tools (ADT) and Autodock 4 in a 45 × 45 × 45 Å grid box with a spacing of 0.375 Å using Lamarckian Genetic Algorithm.The redocking analysis was successfully performed when the RMSD value was <2 Å (Huey et al., 2007).A hundred molecular docking poses for each ligand were ranked on their docking score.The scoring function in AutoDock was used to predict the binding affinity of the ligand to the receptor.The conformation with the lowest binding energy was chosen as the most suitable conformation.The docking result was visualized using ADT and Discovery Studio Visualizer.


RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

The synthesis of chalcone A-C (Fig. 2) was accomplished via the aldol condensation reaction with the addition of sodium hydroxide as a basic catalyst to afford products in excellent yield and purity.Those syntheses were carried out according to the literature (Susanti et al., 2012) with slight modification.Table 1 presents the physical data of the chalcones.The characterization of the synthesized chalcones was conducted by GC-MS, FTIR, and NMR spectrometers.The MS spectra confirmed the molecular weight of the desired chalcones.Characteristic molecular ion peaks (M + and M +2 ) with the height ratio of 3:1 were observed in chalcone A. This confirmed the presence of two chlorine isotopes,

Cl and 37 Cl.The IR spectra displayed some important peaks.The presence of C sp2 -H bending band at 979-987 cm −1 for transdisubstituted alkene and the absence of C-H aldehyde stretching bands confirmed that chalcone A-C were correctly achieved.The 1 H-NMR spectra of chalcone displayed two doublet signals with J (coupling constant) value of 15.55 Hz proving the presence of alkene protons with a trans coupling (Raza et al., 2016).Signals that corresponded with the trans-alkene carbons were also observed in 13 C-NMR spectra.

The cyclocondensation reaction of the chalcone A-C and hydrazine hydrate with the addition of glacial acetic acid produced N-acetyl pyrazoline A-C (Fig. 2).The obtained pyrazolines have high yield and purity.Table 1 reports the physical data of these products.The structure of pyrazoline A-C was confirmed by several important spectral changes.The mass spectra confirmed the molecular weight of the synthesized pyrazolines.The IR spectra showed the absence of trans-disubstituted alkene at 978 cm −1 as well as the presence of new absorption peaks for C=N (~1,597 cm −1 ) and C-N (~1,142 cm −1 ) confirming the formation of a pyrazoline ring.The 1 H-NMR spectra displayed the existence of characteristic signals with AMX spin system due to the diastereotopic nature of methylene protons on the pyrazoline ring (Suma et al., 2017).Thus, their splitting patterns came as a doublet of doublets at the region of δ 3 and 4 ppm.Furthermore, the CH proton on the pyrazoline ring arose as a doublet of doublet at the region of δ 5 ppm owing to vicinal coupling with methylene protons.The 13 C-NMR spectra confirmed the absence signals of trans-alkene carbons and the appearing signals of carbons on the pyrazoline ring.The synthesized pyrazolines A-C were evaluated as anticancer agents using MTT against breast cancer lines (MCF7 and T47D), the cervical cancer line (HeLa), and the normal cell line (Vero).Table 2 summarizes the percentage of cell growth inhibition of pyrazolines A and B. This result shows a correlation between sample concentrations with the percentage of cell growth inhibition: higher concentration resulted in less cell growth.Thus, the inhibition percentage is increasing; this is understandable because typically the more concentrated the compound is, the more toxic it becomes.

The percentage of cell growth inhibition was converted into the IC 50 value.The activity of compounds on their cell growth inhibition is classified into three categories, i.e., active (IC 50 < 20 µg/ml), moderate (IC 50 20-100 µg/ml), and inactive (IC 50 > 100 µg/ ml) (Tanamatayarat et al., 2003).Table 3 shows the IC 50 values of the synthesized pyrazoline A-C and commercial drugs.According to the reference stated above, pyrazoline A has moderate activity in the inhibition of all tested cancer cell line MCF7 (IC 50 40.47µg/ ml), T47D (IC 50 26.51µg/ml), and HeLa (IC 50 31.19µg/ml).The most potent activity of pyrazoline A is against the breast cancer cell line T47D.Pyrazoline B is inactive in the inhibition of all tested cancer cell lines (IC 50 > 100 µg/ml).Despite its inactivity, pyrazoline B is deemed selective as compared with its activity against normal cell Vero (IC 50 44 × 10 3 µg/ml).This compound has a selectivity index of 64.6, 16.3, and 5.8 against MCF7, T47D, and HeLa, respectively.On the other hand, pyrazoline C has moderate activity in the inhibition of MCF7 (IC 50 94.02µg/ ml); however, it is inactive against T47D and HeLa.Pyrazoline C is also deemed selective as compared with normal cell Vero (IC 50 9 × 10 3 µg/ml) with a selectivity index of 98.1, 12.1, and 34.2 against MCF7, T47D, and HeLa, respectively.Based on this result, the IC 50 values of pyrazoline A against all tested cancer cell lines are shown to be lower than the IC 50 values of pyrazolines B and C. Thus, pyrazoline A is a better anticancer candidate than the others.The difference in their activities is due to the presence of functional groups attached to the molecule.Pyrazoline A with the presence of the halogen p-Cl substituent on the benzene A-ring displayed more potent activity.Meanwhile, the presence of a hydroxyl substituent on the benzene A-ring of pyrazoline B and C decreased their activity.

A molecular docking study was performed to understand how pyrazolines interact with the receptor.An EGFR receptor was used as the protein is often overexpressed in breast and cervical cancer (Masuda et al., 2012;Mubeen et al., 2015).Other studies also reported the use of the EGFR receptor on the docking molecule of pyrazoline derivatives (Lv et al., 2010;Yang et al., 2013).The redocking analysis of EGFR with the original ligand (Erlotinib) showed its binding site on the MET769 residue.This binding site was then used to perform a docking simulation of the pyrazoline compounds.The binding models of pyrazolines with EGFR are shown in Fig 3 and the result was summarized in Table 4.

Pyrazoline A and C is nicely bound to the EGFR receptor through hydrogen bond with the side chain of MET769 residue.The binding energy of pyrazoline A is −7.24 kcal/mol.The oxygen atom on m-OCH 3 of ring B contributes to the hydrogen bonding interaction with the hydrogen atom on the side chain of MET769 (distance: 1.946 Å).The π-cation interaction occurred between ring A and the LYS721 residue indicates that the presence of ring A on pyrazoline has enhanced the interaction of ligand and receptor.Compared with pyrazoline A, the interaction between pyrazoline C and EGFR receptor is less preferable which is   showed from its binding energy of −7.15 kcal/mol.The hydrogen bonding interaction occurred between oxygen atom on m-OCH 3 of ring B with the hydrogen atom on the side chain of MET769 residue (distance: 1.986 Å).The π-cation interaction is observed between ring A and the LYS721 residue.Meanwhile, there is no interaction between pyrazoline B and MET769 residue which led to the conclusion that pyrazoline B is the less active compound among the others.The molecular docking result together with the cytotoxicity evaluation data infers that pyrazoline A is a better anticancer agent.


CONCLUSION

The novel N-acetyl pyrazoline derivatives containing methoxy groups obtained from veratraldehyde were successfully synthesized in excellent yield and purity by the cyclocondensation of chalcones and hydrazine hydrate in glacial acetic acid.Cytotoxicity evaluation revealed that the presence of a halogen substituent such as chloro on a pyrazoline derivative (pyrazoline A) increased its cytotoxic activity against some cancer cell lines, while the presence of hydroxyl substituent (pyrazoline B and C) decreased the anticancer activity.The molecular docking study showed that pyrazoline A could nicely bind to the active site of the EGFR receptor via hydrogen bonding with MET769 and π-cation interaction with LYS721.
